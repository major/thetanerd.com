E&P companies are the **high-beta play** on oil prices. They find and extract oil, with earnings highly leveraged to commodity prices. When oil moves 10%, E&P earnings often move 15-25%.

## Why E&P is different

E&P companies have fixed costs but variable revenue tied to oil prices:

| Oil Price Move | Typical E&P Impact |
|----------------|-------------------|
| +10% oil | +15-25% earnings |
| -10% oil | -15-25% earnings |
| Below breakeven | Losses, potential distress |

Unlike integrated majors (XLE), E&P has no downstream buffer — pure upstream exposure.

## ETFs compared

| ETF | Weighting | Expense | Beta |
|-----|-----------|---------|------|
| [**XOP**](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/spdr-sp-oil-gas-exploration-production-etf-xop) | Equal-weight | 0.35% | Highest |
| [**IEO**](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239509/ishares-us-oil-gas-exploration-production-etf) | Market-cap | 0.40% | Moderate-high |
| [**PXE**](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PXE) | Dynamic | 0.60% | Moderate-high |
| [**FCG**](https://www.ftportfolios.com/Retail/Etf/EtfSummary.aspx?Ticker=FCG) | Natural gas | 0.57% | High |

### XOP vs IEO

| Factor | XOP | IEO |
|--------|-----|-----|
| Weighting | Equal-weight | Cap-weighted |
| Small-cap exposure | ~19% | Lower |
| Volatility | Higher | Moderate |

**XOP** amplifies moves more — use for aggressive oil plays.

## Breakeven economics

E&P profitability depends on where oil trades vs. breakeven costs:

| WTI Price | E&P Condition |
|-----------|---------------|
| Above $75 | Profitable expansion |
| $65-$75 | Marginal profitability |
| $60-$65 | At breakeven |
| Below $60 | Unprofitable — budget cuts |

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
Below $60/barrel, E&P companies cut capex immediately. Below $50 triggers steep cuts.

## Key drivers

| Driver | What to Watch |
|--------|---------------|
| Baker Hughes Rig Count | Rising = production growth coming |
| DUC Wells | Low inventory = new drilling needed |
| Production Efficiency | Higher output per rig offsets count declines |

## When to favor E&P vs. integrated

| Condition | Favor |
|-----------|-------|
| Oil acceleration | XOP |
| Backwardation | XOP |
| Oil weakness | XLE |
| Recession fears | XLE |

## Quick reference

| Situation | Best Choice |
|-----------|-------------|
| Maximum oil beta | XOP |
| Balanced E&P | IEO |
| Natural gas focus | FCG |
| Defensive energy | XLE |

{{< callout type="tip" >}}
XOP is high-beta — it amplifies oil moves both ways. Watch breakeven costs carefully.
