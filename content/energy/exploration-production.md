Exploration and production (E&P) companies are the **high-beta play** on oil prices. They find and extract oil, with earnings highly leveraged to commodity prices. This page covers E&P ETF mechanics and fundamentals.

For trading signals and relative charts, see [Energy Market Signals]({{< ref "energy-signals" >}}).

## What makes E&P special?

E&P companies have relatively fixed costs (drilling rigs, leases, personnel) but variable revenue tied directly to oil prices. This creates **asymmetric earnings sensitivity**:

| Oil Price Move | Typical E&P Earnings Impact |
|----------------|----------------------------|
| +10% oil | +15-25% earnings |
| -10% oil | -15-25% earnings |
| Below breakeven | Losses, potential distress |

### Pure upstream exposure

Unlike integrated majors (XLE), E&P companies have no downstream buffer:

| Company Type | Oil Price Sensitivity |
|-------------|----------------------|
| **E&P (XOP)** | Very High — pure upstream |
| **Integrated (XLE)** | Moderate — refining hedges |

When you buy XOP, you're making a concentrated bet on oil prices.

## Which E&P ETFs should I watch?

### Primary E&P ETFs

| ETF | Name | Weighting | Expense Ratio | Beta Profile |
|-----|------|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| [**XOP**](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/spdr-sp-oil-gas-exploration-production-etf-xop) | SPDR S&P Oil & Gas E&P ETF | Equal-weight | 0.35% | Highest |
| [**IEO**](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239509/ishares-us-oil-gas-exploration-production-etf) | iShares U.S. Oil & Gas E&P ETF | Market-cap | 0.40% | Moderate-high |
| [**PXE**](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PXE) | Invesco Energy E&P ETF | Dynamic | 0.60% | Moderate-high |
| [**FCG**](https://www.ftportfolios.com/Retail/Etf/EtfSummary.aspx?Ticker=FCG) | First Trust Natural Gas ETF | Natural gas | 0.57% | High |

### XOP vs IEO: Key Differences

| Characteristic | XOP | IEO |
|---------------|-----|-----|
| Weighting | Modified equal-weight | Market-cap weighted |
| Small-cap exposure | ~19% | Lower |
| Includes integrated majors | Yes (Exxon, Chevron) | No |
| Volatility | Higher | Moderate |

**Trading implication**: XOP amplifies moves more. Use XOP for aggressive oil plays; use IEO for more balanced exposure.

## Breakeven economics

E&P profitability depends entirely on where oil trades relative to **breakeven costs**:

### Dallas Fed Survey Data (2025)

| Metric | Price Level |
|--------|-------------|
| Average breakeven (new well) | $65/barrel |
| Operating expense coverage | $41/barrel |
| Large firm breakeven | $61/barrel |
| Small firm breakeven | $66/barrel |

### What breakeven means for trading

| WTI Price | E&P Condition | Typical Response |
|-----------|---------------|------------------|
| Above $75 | Profitable expansion | Increased drilling, distribution growth |
| $65-$75 | Marginal profitability | Maintenance capex only |
| $60-$65 | At breakeven | Capital budget cuts |
| Below $60 | Unprofitable | Steep cuts, potential distress |

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
When oil falls below $60/barrel, E&P companies start cutting capital budgets immediately. Below $50/barrel triggers steep cuts to drilling programs.

## Key fundamental drivers

### Baker Hughes Rig Count

Released weekly (Friday). Leading indicator for future production:

| Rig Count Trend | Implication |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Rising 4+ consecutive weeks | Production growth coming |
| Flat after decline | Bottoming process |
| Declining 8+ weeks | Production decline coming |

### DUC Wells (Drilled but Uncompleted)

Wells drilled but not yet producing — future supply optionality:

| DUC Trend | Implication |
|-----------|-------------|
| Rising | Future supply building |
| Falling | Inventory drawdown; new drilling needed |

**Current signal**: DUC inventory at record lows (~4,400 wells). Production growth now requires new drilling.

### Production Efficiency

Even with fewer rigs, production per rig has increased ~9% YoY due to technology improvements. This partially offsets rig count declines.

## E&P sector composition

XOP holds a mix of company types:

| Category | Description | Oil Sensitivity |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Pure E&P | Drill and produce only | Highest |
| Integrated E&P | Some midstream assets | High |
| Refiners | ~16% of XOP | Different dynamics |

The refiner weight in XOP means it doesn't track pure E&P perfectly.

## Key ratios for E&P

For detailed signal interpretation, see [Energy Market Signals]({{< ref "energy-signals" >}}).

| Ratio | What It Measures | Quick Interpretation |
|-------|------------------|---------------------|
| **XOP/SPY** | E&P vs. stocks | Rising = energy rotation |
| **XOP/XLE** | E&P vs. integrated | Rising = favor high-beta |
| **XOP/OIH** | Producers vs. services | Rising = production focus |

## When to favor E&P vs. integrated

| Condition | Favor | Why |
|-----------|-------|-----|
| Oil acceleration | XOP | Higher leverage to upside |
| Backwardation | XOP | Rewards current production |
| Oil weakness | XLE | Downstream hedges buffer losses |
| Contango | XLE | Integrated players manage storage |
| Recession fears | XLE | Larger caps, stronger balance sheets |

## Quick reference

| Situation | Best E&P Instrument |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Maximum oil beta | XOP |
| Balanced E&P exposure | IEO |
| Natural gas focus | FCG |
| Defensive energy | XLE (not E&P) |

{{< callout type="tip" >}}
**The bottom line:** XOP is a **high-beta instrument** — it amplifies oil moves in both directions. Watch breakeven costs carefully. When oil approaches $60/barrel, E&P names become dangerous regardless of technicals.
