Oil services companies are the **picks and shovels** of energy. They don't produce oil — they help others produce it. This creates a unique relationship: services often **lead the upturn** and **lag the downturn**.

## Why services are different

Services move with E&P capital spending, not oil prices directly:

| Phase | E&P Behavior | Services Behavior |
|-------|--------------|-------------------|
| Oil rising | Announce budgets | Receive orders (revenue lags) |
| Capex committed | Spending begins | Revenue accelerates |
| Oil falling | Cut budgets | Backlog cushions, then falls |

### Operational leverage

| Utilization | Margin Impact |
|-------------|---------------|
| Above 90% | Pricing power, expansion |
| 80-90% | Stable |
| Below 80% | Competition, compression |

## ETFs compared

| ETF | Weighting | Expense | Focus |
|-----|-----------|---------|-------|
| [**OIH**](https://www.vaneck.com/us/en/investments/oil-services-etf-oih/) | Market-cap | 0.35% | Large-cap services |
| [**XES**](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/spdr-sp-oil-gas-equipment-services-etf-xes) | Equal-weight | 0.35% | Broader diversification |
| [**IEZ**](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239507/ishares-us-oil-equipment-services-etf) | Dow Jones | 0.40% | Similar to XES |

### OIH vs XES

| Factor | OIH | XES |
|--------|-----|-----|
| Top 3 concentration | ~41% | Lower |
| Liquidity | Higher | Lower |
| Small-cap exposure | Lower | Higher |

**OIH** for liquid trading; **XES** for broader diversification.

## Major holdings

OIH is concentrated in three names:

| Company | Weight | Focus |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Schlumberger (SLB) | ~20% | International, digital |
| Baker Hughes (BKR) | ~12% | Equipment |
| Halliburton (HAL) | ~8% | North American shale |

**Reading the leaders:**
- SLB leading = International strengthening
- HAL leading = North America accelerating

## Key drivers

| Driver | Services Implication |
|--------|---------------------|
| Rig count rising 4+ weeks | Revenue growth coming (3-6 mo lag) |
| Day rates rising 10%+ YoY | Tight market, pricing power |
| E&P budget increases | Strong revenue growth coming |
| Utilization > 90% | Maximum pricing power |

## Cycle position

Services often **lead the turn**:

1. Oil stabilizes → E&P confidence builds
2. Budget commitments → Services receive orders (OIH often bottoms here)
3. Rig count inflects → Revenue accelerates
4. Utilization hits 90%+ → Margins expand
5. Peak utilization → OIH often peaks before oil

## When to favor services

| Condition | Favor Services? |
|-----------|-----------------|
| E&P budget increases | Yes |
| Rig count rising | Yes |
| Oil above $70 | Yes |
| Oil below $60 | No — cuts coming |

## Quick reference

| Situation | Best Choice |
|-----------|-------------|
| Large-cap, liquid | OIH |
| Broader diversification | XES |
| Offshore focus | Individual names |

{{< callout type="tip" >}}
OIH is a capex cycle indicator, not just an oil play. Watch rig counts and E&P budgets.
