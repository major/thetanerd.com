Oil services companies are the **picks and shovels** of the energy sector. They don't produce oil — they help others produce it. This creates a unique relationship with the commodity cycle: services often **lead** the upturn and **lag** the downturn.

For trading signals and relative charts, see [Energy Market Signals]({{< ref "energy-signals" >}}).

## What makes oil services special?

Services companies don't move with oil prices directly — they move with **E&P capital spending**:

| Phase | E&P Behavior | Services Behavior |
|-------|--------------|-------------------|
| Oil rising | Announce budget increases | Receive orders, revenue lags |
| Capex committed | Spending begins | Revenue accelerates |
| Oil falling | Cut budgets | Backlog cushions, then falls |
| Trough | Minimal spending | Utilization collapses |

### Operational leverage

Like E&P, services have high fixed costs. This creates amplified moves:

| Utilization Rate | Margin Impact |
|------------------|---------------|
| Above 90% | Pricing power, margin expansion |
| 80-90% | Stable margins |
| Below 80% | Price competition, margin compression |

### Leading indicator properties

OIH can signal turns before XOP and USO. When E&P companies commit to drilling budgets, services see it first in order books — before production changes.

## Which oil services ETFs should I watch?

### Primary Oil Services ETFs

| ETF | Name | Weighting | Expense Ratio | Focus |
|-----|------|-----------|---------------|-------|
| [**OIH**](https://www.vaneck.com/us/en/investments/oil-services-etf-oih/) | VanEck Oil Services ETF | Market-cap | 0.35% | Large-cap services |
| [**XES**](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/spdr-sp-oil-gas-equipment-services-etf-xes) | SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Equipment & Services | Equal-weight | 0.35% | Broader diversification |
| [**IEZ**](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239507/ishares-us-oil-equipment-services-etf) | iShares U.S. Oil Equipment & Services | Dow Jones index | 0.40% | Similar to XES |

### OIH vs XES: Key Differences

| Characteristic | OIH | XES |
|---------------|-----|-----|
| Weighting | Market-cap | Equal-weight |
| Top 3 concentration | ~41% | Lower |
| Liquidity | Higher | Lower |
| Small-cap exposure | Lower | Higher |

**Trading implication**: OIH is better for liquid trading and large-cap exposure. XES provides broader diversification.

## Major holdings and what they signal

OIH is concentrated in three dominant names:

| Company | Ticker | Weight | Focus | What It Signals |
|---------|--------|--------|-------|-----------------|
| **Schlumberger** | SLB | ~20% | Integrated services, digital | International markets |
| **Baker Hughes** | BKR | ~12% | Equipment, turbomachinery | Industrial diversification |
| **Halliburton** | HAL | ~8% | Drilling, completion | North American shale |

### Reading the leaders

- **SLB leading**: International markets strengthening
- **HAL leading**: North American activity accelerating
- **Offshore names leading**: Long-cycle deepwater projects gaining momentum

## Key fundamental drivers

### Baker Hughes Rig Count

Primary leading indicator for services revenue:

| Rig Count Trend | Services Implication |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Rising 4+ consecutive weeks | Revenue growth coming (3-6 month lag) |
| Flat after decline | Bottoming process |
| Declining 8+ weeks | Revenue decline coming |

### Day Rates

Real-time pricing signal for equipment/services:

| Day Rate Trend | What It Signals |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Rising 10%+ YoY | Tight market, pricing power |
| Stable | Balanced supply/demand |
| Falling 5%+ QoQ | Oversupply, competition |

**Current offshore rates**: High-spec floaters at ~$450,000/day — strong pricing power.

### E&P Capex Budgets

Announcements drive services revenue with 1-2 quarter lag:

| Budget Trend | Services Impact |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Increases 10%+ | Strong revenue growth coming |
| Flat | Stable revenue |
| Cuts announced | Revenue decline coming |

### Utilization Rates

Drives margin expansion or compression:

| Utilization | Margin Environment |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Above 90% | Pricing power |
| 85-90% | Stable |
| Below 85% | Competitive pressure |

## Cycle position in services

Services have a distinct position — they often **lead the turn** but **lag the peak**:

{{% steps %}}

### Oil stabilizes

E&P companies observe sustained prices. Confidence builds.

### Budget commitments

E&Ps announce increased capex. Services receive orders — OIH often bottoms here.

### Rig count inflects

Baker Hughes shows rising activity. Services revenue accelerates.

### Utilization hits 90%+

Equipment scarce. Day rates rise. Services margins expand.

### Peak utilization

Maximum pricing power. OIH often peaks before oil does.

## Key ratios for oil services

For detailed signal interpretation, see [Energy Market Signals]({{< ref "energy-signals" >}}).

| Ratio | What It Measures | Quick Interpretation |
|-------|------------------|---------------------|
| **OIH/SPY** | Services vs. stocks | Rising = capex cycle accelerating |
| **OIH/XOP** | Services vs. producers | Rising = late cycle, spending up |
| **OIH/XLE** | Services vs. broad energy | Rising = services leading |
| **SLB/HAL** | International vs. N. America | Rising = international strength |

## When to favor services

| Condition | Favor Services? | Why |
|-----------|-----------------|-----|
| E&P budget increases | Yes | Order flow coming |
| Rig count rising | Yes | Activity confirmation |
| Utilization > 90% | Yes, but watch for peak | Pricing power |
| Oil above $70 | Yes | Capex sustainable |
| Oil below $60 | No | Budget cuts coming |

## Quick reference

| Situation | Best Services Instrument |
|-----------|-------------------------|
| Large-cap, liquid trading | OIH |
| Broader diversification | XES |
| Offshore focus | Individual names (RIG, FTI) |

{{< callout type="tip" >}}
**The bottom line:** OIH is a **capex cycle indicator**, not just an oil price play. Watch rig counts and E&P budget announcements — they drive services revenue with a lag. When utilization hits 90%+ and day rates are at cycle highs, the easy money has been made.
