description: "Solar, wind, and renewable energy ETFs — ICLN, TAN, QCLN compared"
---

Clean energy trades differently than oil and gas. While crude responds to OPEC and geopolitics, clean energy responds to **interest rates, government policy, and technology costs**.

## Why clean energy is different

| Factor | Traditional (XLE) | Clean (ICLN) |
|--------|-------------------|--------------|
| High oil prices | Bullish | Mixed |
| Rising rates | Neutral | Bearish |
| Policy support | Headwind | Tailwind |

Clean energy often **diverges from XLE** — sometimes dramatically.

## Core ETFs compared

| ETF | Focus | Expense | Holdings |
|-----|-------|---------|----------|
| [**ICLN**](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239738/ishares-global-clean-energy-etf) | Broad global | 0.41% | ~100 |
| [**TAN**](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&productId=ETF-TAN) | Solar only | 0.69% | ~50 |
| [**QCLN**](https://www.ftportfolios.com/Retail/Etf/EtfSummary.aspx?Ticker=QCLN) | US + EVs | 0.58% | ~60 |

### ICLN — Diversified Global

- Global exposure across solar, wind, hydro
- Lower volatility than pure-plays
- Institutional benchmark

### TAN — Solar Pure-Play

- Maximum beta within clean energy
- Significant China exposure
- Higher volatility

### QCLN — US + EV Blend

- Tesla exposure (~5-8%)
- US-centric
- Electrification theme

### Comparison

| Factor | ICLN | TAN | QCLN |
|--------|------|-----|------|
| Geographic | Global | Global (China-heavy) | US-centric |
| Subsector | Diversified | Solar only | Clean + EVs |
| Volatility | Moderate | High | High |
| EV exposure | Minimal | None | Significant |

## Other clean energy ETFs

| ETF | Focus | Expense |
|-----|-------|---------|
| [**FAN**](https://www.ftportfolios.com/Retail/Etf/EtfSummary.aspx?Ticker=FAN) | Wind | 0.60% |
| [**PBW**](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&productId=ETF-PBW) | US equal-weight | 0.61% |
| [**ACES**](https://www.alpsfunds.com/funds/aces) | US + Canada | 0.55% |
| [**RNRG**](https://www.globalxetfs.com/funds/rnrg/) | Renewable producers | 0.65% |
| [**YLCO**](https://www.globalxetfs.com/funds/ylco/) | Yieldcos (income) | 0.65% |

## Key drivers

### Interest Rates (Biggest Factor)

Clean energy projects are capital-intensive with 20-30 year paybacks. Higher rates = lower project returns.

**2022-2023:** Fed rate hikes crushed clean energy despite IRA tailwinds.

### Policy & Subsidies

| Policy | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Investment Tax Credit | Direct solar subsidy |
| Production Tax Credit | Per-kWh wind subsidy |
| Inflation Reduction Act | Extended US subsidies |

**Election risk:** US policy can shift dramatically between administrations.

### Technology Costs

- Solar panels down ~90% since 2010
- Onshore wind down ~70%
- Battery storage down ~85%

Renewables now economically competitive in many regions.

## Key ratios

| Ratio | Rising = | Falling = |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| ICLN/SPY | Clean leading | Market preferred |
| ICLN/XLE | Clean winning | Traditional winning |
| TAN/ICLN | Solar leading | Diversification preferred |

## When to accumulate

**Bullish signals:**
- Fed signaling rate cuts
- ICLN/SPY bottoming
- New policy support
- Cost declines continuing

**Bearish signals:**
- Fed hiking rates
- ICLN/XLE falling
- Policy uncertainty
- Project cancellations

## Which ETF when?

| Situation | Best Choice |
|-----------|-------------|
| Broad exposure | ICLN |
| Solar conviction | TAN |
| US + EV exposure | QCLN |
| Wind conviction | FAN |
| Avoid China risk | ACES |
| Income-oriented | YLCO, RNRG |

{{< callout type="tip" >}}
Clean energy trades on rates and policy, not oil. Don't fight the Fed — rate hikes crush this sector regardless of policy support.
