Energy offers clear relative strength signals because different segments respond differently to oil prices. By monitoring ratios between crude oil, E&P stocks, services companies, and midstream infrastructure, you can identify sector rotation and cycle turns before they become obvious.

## The energy sector hierarchy

| Segment | ETF | Oil Price Sensitivity |
|---------|-----|----------------------|
| Crude Oil | USO | Direct |
| E&P (Producers) | XOP | Very High |
| Services (Drillers) | OIH | High |
| Midstream (Pipelines) | AMLP | Low-Moderate |
| Broad Energy | XLE | Moderate |

**Not all energy ETFs move together** — this hierarchy drives all the signals below.

## Core ratios

### XOP/XLE — E&P vs. Integrated Majors

The **key ratio** for choosing between high-beta and defensive energy:

| Behavior | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Rising | Favor XOP — high-beta wins |
| Falling | Favor XLE — integrated buffers losses |
| Breaking out | Overweight XOP aggressively |
| Breaking down | Rotate to XLE defensively |

### OIH/XOP — Services vs. Producers

Reveals capex cycle position:

| Behavior | Cycle Phase |
|----------|-------------|
| Rising | Late cycle — services capturing spending |
| Falling | Early cycle — producers lead |
| Bottoming | Cycle turn — services seeing orders |

### AMLP/XLE — Midstream vs. Broad Energy

The divergence detector:

| Behavior | Signal |
|----------|--------|
| Rising | Fee-based > commodity exposure |
| Falling | Oil rally lifting upstream |
| AMLP up, XLE down | Defensive rotation to yield |

### USO/SPY — Crude Oil vs. Market

| Behavior | Signal |
|----------|--------|
| Sharp spike | Geopolitical shock |
| Steady grind up | Commodity inflation trade |
| Steady grind down | Demand destruction, strong dollar |

### USO/GLD — Oil vs. Gold

Compares growth commodity to fear commodity:

| Behavior | Signal |
|----------|--------|
| Rising | Growth optimism |
| Falling | Risk-off, flight to safety |

**Historical note:** When gold buys 50+ barrels of oil (vs ~15-20 average), oil is likely oversold.

## Cycle phases

### Accumulation (Beginning)

**Signals:**
- Futures curve flipping to backwardation
- XOP/XLE breaking out
- OIH/XOP bottoming
- Rig counts stabilizing after decline

**Action:** Accumulate energy. Favor XOP for high-beta.

### Confirmation (Middle)

**Signals:**
- USO/SPY in clear uptrend
- Rig counts rising consistently
- Oil above breakeven ($65+)

**Action:** Hold positions. Add on pullbacks.

### Distribution (End)

**Signals:**
- XOP/XLE rolling over
- OIH/XOP at cycle highs
- Universal bullish consensus
- Contango returning

**Action:** Tighten stops. Rotate to XLE or AMLP.

## Quick signal dashboard

### Bullish (Accumulate Energy)

| Signal | What You See |
|--------|--------------|
| Backwardation | USO front > back months |
| E&P leadership | XOP/XLE rising |
| Services inflecting | OIH/SPY bottoming |
| Rigs rising | 4+ consecutive weeks up |
| Oil above breakeven | WTI > $65/barrel |

| Signal | What You See |
|--------|--------------|
| Contango | USO front < back months |
| E&P lagging | XOP/XLE falling |
| Services rolling | OIH/SPY breaking down |
| Rigs declining | 8+ consecutive weeks down |

## Trading strategies

### Cycle Rotation

**Setup:** XOP/XLE breaks out from consolidation  
**Entry:** Buy XOP on breakout confirmation  
**Exit:** XOP/XLE breaks below 50-day MA

### Capex Cycle Trade

**Setup:** OIH/SPY bottoming + E&P budget increases announced  
**Entry:** Buy OIH when 50-day MA turns up  
**Exit:** OIH/XOP at cycle highs + capex softening

### Income Rotation

**Setup:** AMLP yield > 8% + AMLP/SPY bottoming  
**Entry:** Buy AMLP on higher low in ratio  
**Exit:** Yield compresses < 7%

### Divergence Play

**Setup:** AMLP rising while oil falling  
**Entry:** Buy AMLP on 3+ weeks confirmation  
**Exit:** Oil stabilizes and XLE catches up

## Ratio quick reference

|-------|----------|-----------|
| **XOP/XLE** | High-beta leading | Defensive energy |
