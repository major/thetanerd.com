The energy sector offers some of the clearest **relative strength signals** in the market. By monitoring ratios between crude oil, E&P stocks, services companies, and midstream infrastructure, traders can identify sector rotation, capex cycle turns, and oil price inflections before they show up in headlines.

This page consolidates the key relative charts and trading signals across the energy complex into a single dashboard.

## The energy sector hierarchy

Energy isn't monolithic — it's a value chain where each segment responds differently to oil prices:

| Segment | ETF | Oil Price Sensitivity | What Drives It | Learn More |
|---------|-----|----------------------|----------------|------------|
| **Crude Oil** | USO | Direct | Supply/demand, OPEC+, geopolitics | [Crude Oil ETFs]({{< ref "crude-oil" >}}) |
| **E&P (Producers)** | XOP | Very High | Oil prices, breakeven costs | [E&P ETFs]({{< ref "exploration-production" >}}) |
| **Services (Drillers)** | OIH | High | E&P capex spending, rig counts | [Oil Services ETFs]({{< ref "oil-services" >}}) |
| **Midstream (Pipelines)** | AMLP | Low-Moderate | Throughput volumes, not prices | [MLP & Midstream ETFs]({{< ref "mlps-midstream" >}}) |
| **Broad Energy** | XLE | Moderate | Weighted toward integrated majors | — |

Understanding this hierarchy is key: **not all energy ETFs move together**.

## Essential relative charts

### USO/SPY — Crude Oil vs. Market

The foundational ratio for understanding oil's macro role:

| USO/SPY Behavior | Signal | Interpretation |
|------------------|--------|----------------|
| Sharp spike up | Geopolitical shock | Supply disruption, risk premium |
| Steady grind up | Inflation trade | Commodity cycle, inflation concerns |
| Steady grind down | Demand destruction | Strong dollar, oversupply, recession |
| Sharp drop | Risk-off panic | Flight from commodities |

**When to use**: Macro regime identification. Rising USO/SPY = commodity inflation trade working.

### XOP/SPY — E&P vs. Market

Shows whether high-beta energy is attracting capital:

| XOP/SPY Behavior | Signal | Interpretation |
|------------------|--------|----------------|
| Rising | Energy rotation | Risk-on for commodities, inflation concerns |
| Falling | Growth preferred | Tech/growth leading, energy out of favor |
| Diverging from oil | Warning | Market doesn't trust the oil move |

**When to use**: Sector rotation timing. Rising XOP/SPY = capital flowing into energy.

### XOP/XLE — E&P vs. Integrated Majors

The **key ratio** for choosing between high-beta E&P and defensive integrated majors:

| XOP/XLE Behavior | Condition | Action |
|------------------|-----------|--------|
| Rising | Oil acceleration, backwardation | Favor XOP — high-beta wins |
| Falling | Oil weakness, contango | Favor XLE — integrated majors buffer losses |
| Breaking out | Sustained oil strength | Overweight XOP aggressively |
| Breaking down | Capex cuts, margin pressure | Rotate to XLE defensively |

**When to use**: Within-sector allocation. This tells you which energy exposure to favor.

### OIH/SPY — Oil Services vs. Market

Shows capex cycle momentum:

| OIH/SPY Behavior | Signal | Interpretation |
|------------------|--------|----------------|
| Breaking out from lows | Capex cycle inflecting | Services seeing order flow |
| Steady uptrend | Sustained spending | Utilization rising, pricing power |
| Rolling over from highs | Peak spending | Capex cuts coming |

**When to use**: Capex cycle timing. OIH often leads turns in both directions.

### OIH/XOP — Services vs. Producers

Compares who benefits from drilling activity:

| OIH/XOP Behavior | Cycle Phase | Interpretation |
|------------------|-------------|----------------|
| Rising | Late cycle | Services capturing spending, pricing power |
| Falling | Early cycle | Producers lead, services lag |
| Bottoming | Cycle turn | Services seeing orders before revenue |

**When to use**: Cycle phase identification. OIH/XOP rising = late-cycle capex acceleration.

### AMLP/SPY — Midstream vs. Market

Shows income rotation dynamics:

| AMLP/SPY Behavior | Signal | Interpretation |
|-------------------|--------|----------------|
| Rising | Income rotation | Yield-seeking, defensive positioning |
| Falling | Risk-on | Growth stocks preferred |
| Rising while oil falls | Positive divergence | Fee-based model proving resilient |

**When to use**: Income rotation timing. Midstream often holds up when oil doesn't.

### AMLP/XLE — Midstream vs. Broad Energy

The divergence detector:

| AMLP/XLE Behavior | Signal | Interpretation |
|-------------------|--------|----------------|
| Rising | Stability valued | Fee-based > commodity exposure |
| Falling | Oil rally | Upstream capturing oil upside |
| AMLP up, XLE down | Defensive rotation | Investors hiding in yield |

**When to use**: Defensive vs. cyclical energy positioning.

## Cross-asset signals

### USO/GLD — Oil vs. Gold

Compares the "growth commodity" to the "fear commodity":

| USO/GLD Behavior | Signal | Interpretation |
|------------------|--------|----------------|
| Rising | Growth optimism | Industrial demand strong |
| Falling | Risk-off | Flight to safety, monetary inflation fears |
| At extremes | Mean reversion | Ratio tends to revert over 1-2 years |

**Historical context**: When gold buys 50+ barrels of oil (vs. ~15-20 average), oil is likely oversold.

### Oil/Dollar (USO/UUP)

Traditional inverse relationship (weakening since US became net exporter):

| Relationship | Signal | Caveat |
|--------------|--------|--------|
| Both falling | Risk-off | Classic correlation |
| Both rising | Supply shock | Geopolitics overriding dollar |
| Inverse moving | Normal | Verify with fundamentals |

**When to use**: Macro confirmation. Strong dollar typically pressures oil.

## Cycle phase identification

### Beginning of Energy Cycle

{{< callout type="info" >}}
**Accumulation phase** — Smart money positioning before the move
{{< /callout >}}

**Signals present:**
- Futures curve flipping to backwardation
- XOP/XLE breaking out (E&P leading)
- OIH/XOP bottoming (services seeing orders)
- Rig counts stabilizing after decline
- Analyst sentiment still skeptical
- Little mainstream attention

**Action**: Accumulate energy exposure. Favor XOP for high-beta.

### Middle of Energy Cycle

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
**Confirmation phase** — Trend followers joining
{{< /callout >}}

**Signals present:**
- USO/SPY in clear uptrend
- XOP/SPY rising, XLE/SPY rising
- Rig counts rising consistently
- Oil above breakeven ($65+)
- Media coverage increasing
- Analyst upgrades accelerating

**Action**: Hold positions. Add on pullbacks to rising moving averages.

### End of Energy Cycle

{{< callout type="error" >}}
**Distribution phase** — Time to take profits
{{< /callout >}}

**Signals present:**
- XOP/XLE rolling over (E&P lagging)
- OIH/XOP at cycle highs (services fully valued)
- Universal bullish consensus
- OPEC+ signaling production increases
- Contango returning to futures curve
- Relative charts making lower highs despite price strength

**Action**: Tighten stops. Reduce high-beta (XOP, OIH). Rotate to defensive (XLE, AMLP) or exit.

## Actionable strategies

### Strategy 1: Cycle Rotation

**Setup**: XOP/XLE breaks out from consolidation

**Entry**: Buy XOP on breakout confirmation (close above resistance)

**Management**: 
- Add on pullbacks to 20-day MA
- Rotate to XLE when XOP/XLE rolls over

**Exit**: XOP/XLE breaks below 50-day MA

### Strategy 2: Capex Cycle Trade

**Setup**: OIH/SPY bottoming after prolonged decline + E&P budget increases announced

**Entry**: Buy OIH when 50-day MA turns up

**Management**:
- Hold while rig count rising
- Watch utilization for pricing power

**Exit**: OIH/XOP at cycle highs + capex guidance softening

### Strategy 3: Income Rotation

**Setup**: AMLP yield > 8% + AMLP/SPY bottoming

**Entry**: Buy AMLP on higher low in ratio

**Management**:
- Hold for yield + distribution growth
- Monitor coverage ratios (want > 1.5x)

**Exit**: Yield compresses < 7% + risk-on rotation accelerating

### Strategy 4: Divergence Play

**Setup**: AMLP rising while oil falling (positive divergence)

**Entry**: Buy AMLP on confirmation of divergence (3+ weeks)

**Thesis**: Fee-based model proving resilient; market will reprice

**Exit**: Oil stabilizes and XLE catches up (divergence closes)

## Quick reference table

| Ratio | Rising Means | Falling Means | Primary Use |
|-------|--------------|---------------|-------------|
| **USO/SPY** | Oil outperforming | Stocks preferred | Macro regime |
| **XOP/SPY** | E&P rotation | Growth preferred | Sector rotation |
| **XOP/XLE** | High-beta leading | Defensive energy | Within-sector allocation |
| **OIH/SPY** | Capex accelerating | Capex contracting | Cycle timing |
| **OIH/XOP** | Services leading | Producers leading | Cycle phase |
| **AMLP/SPY** | Income rotation | Risk-on | Yield rotation |
| **AMLP/XLE** | Stability valued | Oil rally | Defensive positioning |
| **USO/GLD** | Growth over fear | Fear over growth | Risk sentiment |

{{< callout type="tip" >}}
**The bottom line**: Energy offers clear relative strength signals because different segments respond differently to oil prices. The XOP/XLE ratio tells you whether to favor high-beta or defensive exposure. The OIH/XOP ratio tells you where we are in the capex cycle. And AMLP divergence from oil tells you when fee-based models are being repriced. Monitor these ratios weekly and let them guide your energy allocation.
