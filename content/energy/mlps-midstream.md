Midstream companies own pipelines, storage, and processing plants. They make money by **moving and storing** hydrocarbons — fee-based businesses that profit from volume, not commodity prices.

## Why midstream is different

| Business Model | Revenue Driver | Oil Sensitivity |
|----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| E&P (XOP) | Sell at market | Very High |
| Services (OIH) | E&P capex | High |
| Midstream (AMLP) | Throughput volumes | Low-Moderate |

Think toll road: the operator profits from traffic volume, not car prices.

### Fee-based contracts

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| Take-or-pay | Revenue floor if volumes drop |
| Minimum volume commitments | Demand protection |
| Inflation escalators | Fees rise with CPI |
| Long-term (10-20 years) | Revenue visibility |

## The yield advantage

| Asset Class | Typical Yield (2025) |
|-------------|---------------------|
| MLPs (AMLP) | 7.5-8.0% |
| REITs | 4.5% |
| Utilities | 4.0% |
| 10-Year Treasury | 4.5% |

MLPs offer 300+ basis point premium over alternatives.

## ETFs compared

| ETF | Expense | Yield | Focus |
|-----|---------|-------|-------|
| [**AMLP**](https://www.alpsfunds.com/funds/amlp) | 0.85% | ~8.0% | Pure MLPs, highest yield |
| [**MLPA**](https://www.globalxetfs.com/funds/mlpa/) | 0.45% | ~7.7% | Lower cost |
| [**EMLP**](https://www.ftportfolios.com/Retail/Etf/EtfSummary.aspx?Ticker=EMLP) | 0.95% | ~4.1% | Includes utilities |
| [**TPYP**](https://www.etf.com/TPYP) | 0.40% | ~7.0% | Lowest cost |

## Distribution coverage

The coverage ratio (DCR) measures sustainability:

| DCR | Risk Level |
|-----|------------|
| Above 1.5x | Low — room for growth |
| 1.2-1.5x | Moderate |
| 1.0-1.2x | Higher — cut risk |
| Below 1.0x | Cut likely |

**Sector average (2025):** 1.8-2.0x — very healthy.

## Tax considerations

| Ownership | Tax Form | In IRAs |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| Direct MLP | K-1 (complicated) | UBTI issues if >$1K |
| MLP ETF | 1099 (simple) | No UBTI issues |

**Bottom line:** Use ETFs for simplicity, especially in retirement accounts.

## Interest rate sensitivity

Conventional wisdom says MLPs move inversely with rates. **Data says otherwise:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Correlation with AGG | 0.1 (very low) |
| R² with 10-year | Lower than REITs |

MLPs are "Fed-agnostic" — throughput and coverage matter more than rates.

## The divergence signal

When AMLP rises while oil falls = **positive divergence**:

| Pattern | Signal |
|---------|--------|
| AMLP up, oil down | Fee-based model proving resilient |
| AMLP down more than oil | Volume concerns — investigate |

**2025 example:** Oil fell ~20%, MLPs rose ~10%.

## When to favor midstream

| Condition | Favor? |
|-----------|--------|
| Yield > 8% | Yes |
| Coverage > 1.5x | Yes |
| Oil weakness | Often yes (fee buffer) |
| Volume concerns | No |

## Quick reference

| Situation | Best Choice |
|-----------|-------------|
| Maximum yield | AMLP |
| Lower cost | MLPA, TPYP |
| Tax-advantaged accounts | ETFs (no K-1) |

{{< callout type="tip" >}}
MLPs are volume plays with yield characteristics. Distribution coverage matters more than oil prices.
