Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs) and midstream infrastructure occupy a unique space in energy: they're **fee-based businesses** that profit from volume, not commodity prices. This creates high yields with defensive characteristics.

For trading signals and relative charts, see [Energy Market Signals]({{< ref "energy-signals" >}}).

## What makes midstream special?

Midstream companies own pipelines, storage facilities, and processing plants. They make money by **moving and storing** hydrocarbons, not by producing or selling them:

| Business Model | Revenue Driver | Oil Price Sensitivity |
|----------------|----------------|----------------------|
| **E&P (XOP)** | Sell oil/gas at market prices | Very High |
| **Services (OIH)** | E&P capex spending | High |
| **Midstream (AMLP)** | Throughput volumes | Low to Moderate |

### The toll road model

Think of midstream like a toll road: it doesn't matter if cars are cheap or expensive — the toll operator profits from traffic volume.

### Fee-based contracts

Most midstream contracts include:

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| Take-or-pay | Revenue floor even if volumes drop |
| Minimum volume commitments | Demand protection |
| Inflation escalators | Fees rise with CPI |
| Long-term (10-20 years) | Revenue visibility |

## The yield advantage

MLPs offer yields far above alternatives:

| Asset Class | Typical Yield (2025) |
|-------------|---------------------|
| **MLPs (AMLP)** | 7.5-8.0% |
| **REITs** | 4.5% |
| **Utilities** | 4.0% |
| **High-Yield Bonds** | 5.5-6.0% |
| **10-Year Treasury** | 4.5% |

MLPs offer a **300+ basis point premium** over comparable yield instruments.

## Which MLP/midstream ETFs should I watch?

### Primary MLP/Midstream ETFs

| ETF | Name | Expense Ratio | Yield | Focus |
|-----|------|---------------|-------|-------|
| [**AMLP**](https://www.alpsfunds.com/funds/amlp) | Alerian MLP ETF | 0.85% | ~8.0% | Pure MLPs, highest yield |
| [**MLPA**](https://www.globalxetfs.com/funds/mlpa/) | Global X MLP ETF | 0.45% | ~7.7% | Lower cost |
| [**EMLP**](https://www.ftportfolios.com/Retail/Etf/EtfSummary.aspx?Ticker=EMLP) | First Trust NA Energy Infrastructure | 0.95% | ~4.1% | Includes utilities |
| [**TPYP**](https://www.etf.com/TPYP) | Tortoise NA Pipeline Fund | 0.40% | ~7.0% | Lowest cost |

### Which to choose?

| Goal | Best ETF |
|------|----------|
| Maximum yield | AMLP |
| Lower cost | MLPA or TPYP |
| Diversification (lower yield) | EMLP |

## Distribution coverage

The **distribution coverage ratio (DCR)** measures sustainability:

| DCR | Meaning | Risk Level |
|-----|---------|------------|
| Above 1.5x | Well-covered | Low — room for growth |
| 1.2-1.5x | Adequately covered | Moderate |
| 1.0-1.2x | Tightly covered | Higher — cut risk if conditions worsen |
| Below 1.0x | Uncovered | High — cut likely |

**Sector average (2025)**: 1.8-2.0x — very healthy coverage.

### Major MLP coverage ratios

| Company | Ticker | DCR (2025) |
|---------|--------|------------|
| Energy Transfer | ET | 1.8x |
| Enterprise Products | EPD | 1.5x |
| MPLX | MPLX | 1.3x |
| Plains All American | PAA | 1.75x |

## Tax considerations

### Direct MLP ownership (not ETFs)

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Tax form | K-1 (arrives late, complicates filing) |
| Distribution treatment | 80-90% return of capital (tax-deferred) |
| Selling | Depreciation recapture (ordinary income) |
| In IRAs | Can create UBTI issues if >$1,000 |

### MLP ETF ownership (AMLP, MLPA)

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Tax form | 1099 (simple) |
| Structure | C-corp (double taxation) |
| Distributions | Ordinary income |
| In IRAs | No UBTI issues |

**Bottom line**: Use ETFs for simplicity, especially in retirement accounts.

## Interest rate sensitivity

Conventional wisdom says MLPs move inversely with rates. **The data says otherwise**:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Correlation with bond index (AGG) | 0.1 (very low) |
| R-squared with 10-year Treasury | Lower than REITs, utilities |

MLPs are **"Fed-agnostic"** — their performance depends more on throughput volumes and distribution coverage than on rates.

## Key fundamental drivers

### Natural Gas Production and LNG

Natural gas is the primary growth driver:

| Metric | 2025 | 2026 |
|--------|------|------|
| Natural gas production | 105 Bcf/d | 106 Bcf/d |
| LNG exports | 14.2 Bcf/d | 16.4 Bcf/d |

The US became the first country to export over 100 million metric tons of LNG in 2025.

### Throughput volumes

Monitor:
- US oil/gas production trends
- LNG export volumes
- Pipeline utilization rates

Flat or growing volumes = stable/growing distributions.

## Key ratios for midstream

For detailed signal interpretation, see [Energy Market Signals]({{< ref "energy-signals" >}}).

| Ratio | What It Measures | Quick Interpretation |
|-------|------------------|---------------------|
| **AMLP/SPY** | Midstream vs. stocks | Rising = income rotation |
| **AMLP/XLE** | Midstream vs. energy | Rising = stability valued |
| **AMLP/XLU** | Midstream vs. utilities | Rising = energy infra preferred |
| **AMLP/HYG** | Midstream vs. junk bonds | Rising = MLP yield premium attractive |

## The divergence signal

When AMLP rises while oil falls, it's a **positive divergence**:

| AMLP vs Oil | Signal | Interpretation |
|-------------|--------|----------------|
| AMLP up, oil down | Positive divergence | Fee-based model proving resilient |
| AMLP down more than oil | Negative divergence | Volume concerns, investigate |

**2025 example**: Oil fell ~20%, MLPs rose ~10% — demonstrating fee-based resilience.

## When to favor midstream

| Condition | Favor Midstream? | Why |
|-----------|------------------|-----|
| Yield > 8% | Yes | Attractive entry |
| Coverage > 1.5x | Yes | Sustainable distributions |
| Income rotation | Yes | Defensive yield play |
| Oil weakness | Often yes | Fee-based buffer |
| Volume concerns | No | Throughput drives revenue |

## Quick reference

| Situation | Best Midstream Instrument |
|-----------|--------------------------|
| Maximum yield | AMLP |
| Lower cost | MLPA, TPYP |
| Tax-advantaged accounts | ETFs (no K-1) |
| Direct ownership | EPD, ET, MPLX (requires K-1) |

{{< callout type="tip" >}}
**The bottom line:** MLPs are **volume plays with yield characteristics**, not commodity plays. Distribution coverage above 1.5x and natural gas infrastructure growth matter more than oil prices. Watch for positive divergence (AMLP up while oil down) — that's when midstream proves its defensive value.
