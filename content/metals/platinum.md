Platinum is the **versatile PGM** — a platinum group metal with diverse demand across diesel vehicles, jewelry, industrial applications, and an emerging role in hydrogen fuel cells. Unlike palladium (gasoline-only), platinum's demand mix gives it **multiple narratives** and potential upside from the clean energy transition.

## What makes platinum special?

Platinum has traded at a **discount to palladium** since 2017 — a historical anomaly. For decades, platinum was the "noble" metal, commanding premiums over both gold and palladium. Understanding why that changed, and whether it reverses, is key to trading platinum.

### The Demand Mix: Diversification is Strength

Platinum's demand is spread across multiple sectors:

| Use | % of Demand | What It Does |
|-----|-------------|--------------|
| **Autocatalysts** | ~35-40% | Converts diesel exhaust emissions (NOx, particulates) |
| **Jewelry** | ~25-30% | Platinum rings, watches, luxury goods (especially China, Japan) |
| **Industrial** | ~20-25% | Glass manufacturing, petroleum refining, chemicals |
| **Investment** | ~5-10% | Bars, coins, ETFs |
| **Hydrogen/Fuel Cells** | ~2-3% | Catalyst in PEM fuel cells (growing) |

This diversification is platinum's **structural advantage** over palladium:
- Diesel decline hurts, but it's only 35-40% of demand (vs. palladium's 80% auto exposure)
- Jewelry provides counter-cyclical support
- Hydrogen fuel cells offer long-term growth optionality

### Supply: Same Concentration, Different Mix

Like palladium, platinum supply is concentrated — but the country mix differs:

| Source | % of Supply | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| **South Africa** | ~70% | Dominant producer — Bushveld Complex |
| **Russia** | ~10-12% | Nornickel byproduct |
| **Zimbabwe** | ~8% | Growing producer |
| **North America** | ~5% | Stillwater, Canadian operations |
| **Recycling** | ~25% | Spent autocatalysts, jewelry |

South Africa's dominance creates different risks than palladium's Russia exposure:
- **Power grid issues**: Eskom load-shedding disrupts mining operations
- **Labor disputes**: South African mining strikes are common
- **Currency effects**: Rand weakness can support margins, strength pressures them

### The Diesel Decline (Priced In?)

Platinum's autocatalyst demand took a structural hit when:
1. **Dieselgate (2015)**: VW scandal crushed diesel car demand in Europe
2. **Diesel bans**: European cities began restricting diesel vehicles
3. **Gasoline shift**: Consumers moved to gasoline (palladium) and EVs

But here's the nuance: **diesel decline may be largely priced in**. Platinum fell from $1,800+ (2011) to sub-$900 (2020). The question is whether:
- Diesel decline continues (bearish)
- Substitution for palladium accelerates (bullish)
- Hydrogen fuel cells scale (very bullish long-term)

### The Hydrogen Optionality

This is platinum's **asymmetric upside**:

{{< callout type="info" >}}
**Hydrogen fuel cells use platinum as their catalyst.** If hydrogen vehicles or industrial hydrogen scales, platinum demand could grow significantly.
{{< /callout >}}

Current fuel cell demand is small (~2-3% of total), but:
- Heavy trucks, buses, and trains favor hydrogen over batteries (weight/range)
- Industrial hydrogen (green steel, ammonia) requires electrolyzers
- Government hydrogen strategies (EU, Japan, Korea) are accelerating

For traders: hydrogen is a **call option embedded in platinum**. It may never pay off, but if it does, the upside is substantial.

## Which ETFs should I watch?

### Physical Platinum ETFs

| ETF | Name | Expense Ratio | AUM | Key Feature |
|-----|------|---------------|-----|-------------|
| [**PPLT**](https://www.abrdn.com/en-us/investor/fund-centre/etfs/abrdn-physical-platinum-shares-etf) | abrdn Physical Platinum Shares | 0.60% | ~$1B | Primary US-listed platinum ETF |
| [**SPPP**](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/251780/ishares-physical-platinum-etc) | iShares Physical Platinum ETC | 0.45% | ~$200M | London-listed, physically backed |

**PPLT** is the main instrument for US traders. Liquidity is better than PALL but still thin compared to gold/silver ETFs.

## How does platinum relate to other metals?

### The PPLT/PALL Relationship (Critical Ratio)

Platinum and palladium are **substitutes** in autocatalyst applications. The ratio tells you about relative value and substitution pressure:

- **PPLT/PALL rising**: Platinum gaining on palladium — substitution occurring, or diesel stabilizing
- **PPLT/PALL falling**: Palladium premium expanding — gasoline vehicles still dominant, no substitution

**Historical context**: Platinum traded at a **premium** to palladium for decades. The ratio inverted in 2017 as:
1. Diesel demand collapsed (platinum negative)
2. Gasoline vehicle palladium loading increased (palladium positive)
3. Russian supply concerns spiked palladium

Mean reversion would require substitution to accelerate or hydrogen to scale.

### PPLT/GLD — Platinum vs. Gold

- **Rising**: Platinum outperforming — industrial/auto strength or undervaluation correction
- **Falling**: Gold preferred — risk-off or platinum-specific headwinds

Historically, platinum traded at a **premium to gold**. The current discount (~$1,000 platinum vs. ~$2,600 gold) is extreme by historical standards.

### PPLT/SPY — Platinum vs. Market

- **Rising**: Platinum outperforming equities — industrial demand or supply squeeze
- **Falling**: Risk-on without platinum — demand concerns or oversupply

### Supply Disruption Rally

When platinum rallies on South African supply issues:

{{% steps %}}

### Eskom or labor news breaks

Power outages, mine strikes, or safety shutdowns in South Africa.

### PPLT and PALL both spike

Both PGMs affected, but platinum more (70% South African supply).

### Rand moves inversely

Weak rand = mining margin support; strong rand = cost pressure.

### Mean reversion as supply normalizes

Supply disruptions are usually temporary.

## How do I put this all together?

### Daily Checklist

1. **Check PPLT/PALL ratio** — Is substitution trade gaining traction?
2. **Check South Africa news** — Eskom, labor, or production issues?
3. **Check hydrogen news** — Policy announcements, fuel cell launches?
4. **Check PPLT/GLD** — Is platinum gaining on gold?
5. **Check auto production data** — Diesel vs. gasoline vs. EV mix trends

### Entry Conditions (Undervaluation Thesis)

- PPLT/PALL at extreme discount (0.4:1 or lower)
- PPLT/GLD at multi-decade lows
- Substitution announcements from automakers
- Hydrogen policy catalysts emerging
- South African supply stable

### Exit Conditions

- PPLT/PALL approaching 1:1 (mean reversion complete)
- Hydrogen thesis fading without follow-through
- Diesel demand declining faster than substitution gains
- South African supply surge
- Crowded positioning, media coverage of "platinum comeback"

## Quick reference

| Phase | What to Watch | What's Happening |
|-------|---------------|------------------|
| {{< badge content="Undervalued" color="blue" >}} | Extreme PPLT/PALL discount, no catalyst | Deep value, needs trigger |
| {{< badge content="Catalyst" color="yellow" >}} | Substitution or hydrogen news | Thesis gaining traction |
| {{< badge content="Revaluation" color="green" >}} | Ratios compressing, ETF inflows | Mean reversion working |

{{< callout type="tip" >}}
**The bottom line:** Platinum is the "cheap PGM" with optionality. Its diversified demand (diesel + jewelry + industrial + hydrogen) provides more resilience than palladium's auto-only exposure. The PPLT/PALL ratio at historic lows creates a mean reversion opportunity, but you need a catalyst — substitution or hydrogen — to unlock it.
