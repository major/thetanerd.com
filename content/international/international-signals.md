---

The US vs. international equity rotation is one of the **longest-duration cycles** in markets — often lasting 5-10 years in each direction. Unlike sector rotations that can flip in months, geographic allocation shifts are driven by structural forces: currency regimes, valuation mean reversion, and relative economic growth. The good news? These cycles are readable if you know what to watch.

This page consolidates the key relative charts and trading signals for timing US vs. international allocation.

## The international equity hierarchy

International equities aren't monolithic — they span a spectrum from stable developed markets to volatile emerging economies:

| Segment | Representative ETF | Volatility | What Drives It | Learn More |
|---------|-------------------|------------|----------------|------------|
| **Developed Markets** | EFA | Moderate | Europe, Japan, dollar cycle | [Developed Markets]({{< ref "developed-markets" >}}) |
| **Emerging Markets** | EEM | High | China, commodities, risk appetite | [Emerging Markets]({{< ref "emerging-markets" >}}) |
| **Total International** | VEU, VXUS | Moderate | Blend of above, dollar dominant | [Total International]({{< ref "total-international" >}}) |
| **Currency Hedged** | HEDJ, DBEF | Lower | Local returns only, no FX | [Currency Hedging]({{< ref "currency-hedging" >}}) |

Understanding this hierarchy is key: **developed and emerging markets often move differently**, and dollar exposure can dominate returns for US-based investors.

## The primary driver: the US dollar

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
**The dollar is the single most important factor for US investors in international equities.** A 10% move in the dollar can easily overwhelm local market returns.
{{< /callout >}}

For US-based investors, international equity returns have two components:
1. **Local market returns** (how the stocks perform in their home currency)
2. **Currency translation** (how the foreign currency moves vs. USD)

When the dollar weakens, US investors get a **double benefit**: local returns plus currency gains. When the dollar strengthens, they face a **double headwind**.

### DXY — The Dollar Index

The DXY (US Dollar Index) measures the dollar against a basket of major currencies (euro, yen, pound, etc.). It's the single most important chart for international equity allocation:

| DXY Behavior | Signal | International Equity Impact |
|--------------|--------|----------------------------|
| Breaking down | Dollar weakness | **Tailwind** — international outperforms |
| Breaking out | Dollar strength | **Headwind** — US outperforms |
| Range-bound | Neutral regime | Local fundamentals dominate |
| Sharp spike | Risk-off panic | Flight to dollar, international sells off |

**Historical context**: The DXY cycle typically lasts 7-10 years. Major dollar peaks occurred in 1985, 2001, and 2022. Major dollar troughs occurred in 1992, 2008, and potentially forming now.

### Dollar cycle phases

| Phase | DXY Pattern | International Allocation |
|-------|-------------|-------------------------|
| **Dollar bull market** | Higher highs, higher lows | Underweight international |
| **Dollar peak/reversal** | Failed breakout, lower high | Start adding international |
| **Dollar bear market** | Lower highs, lower lows | Overweight international |
| **Dollar trough/reversal** | Failed breakdown, higher low | Reduce international, add US |

## Essential relative charts

### EFA/SPY — Developed Markets vs. US

The **key ratio** for developed market allocation. EFA (EAFE — Europe, Australasia, Far East) vs. SPY shows whether developed international markets are leading or lagging:

| EFA/SPY Behavior | Signal | Interpretation |
|------------------|--------|----------------|
| Breaking multi-year downtrend | Regime change | Major rotation to international underway |
| Making higher highs | Developed outperformance | Increase EFA/VEA allocation |
| Making lower lows | US dominance continues | Favor SPY, underweight international |
| Diverging from dollar | Warning | Something unusual — investigate |

**When to use**: Primary allocation signal between US and developed international. Check weekly.

### EEM/SPY — Emerging Markets vs. US

Shows risk appetite for emerging markets relative to US equities:

| EEM/SPY Behavior | Signal | Interpretation |
|------------------|--------|----------------|
| Rising sharply | EM risk-on | Add emerging market exposure |
| Falling sharply | EM risk-off | Reduce EM, flight to quality |
| Outperforming EFA/SPY | EM leading developed | Favor EM within international |
| Underperforming EFA/SPY | Defensive international | Favor developed over EM |

**When to use**: Risk appetite signal. EM is higher beta — when EEM/SPY rises, global risk appetite is strong.

### VEU/SPY — Total International vs. US

The broadest international vs. US comparison (VEU = FTSE All-World ex-US):

| VEU/SPY Behavior | Signal | Interpretation |
|------------------|--------|----------------|
| Rising | International outperforming | Increase total international allocation |
| Falling | US outperforming | Favor domestic equities |
| Bottoming after extended decline | Potential regime change | Watch for confirmation |

**When to use**: Long-term allocation signal. Less volatile than EEM/SPY, captures the overall trend.

### EFA/EEM — Developed vs. Emerging

Shows preference **within** international allocations:

| EFA/EEM Behavior | Signal | Interpretation |
|------------------|--------|----------------|
| Rising | Defensive international | Prefer developed markets (EFA, VEA) |
| Falling | Aggressive international | Prefer emerging markets (EEM, VWO) |
| At extremes | Mean reversion likely | Opposite segment may outperform |

**When to use**: Tactical allocation within international. When risk appetite is high, EM typically leads.

## Cross-asset signals

### EMB/TLT — Emerging Market Bonds vs. Treasuries

Emerging market bonds (EMB) vs. US Treasuries (TLT) shows credit risk appetite for EM:

| EMB/TLT Behavior | Signal | EM Equity Implication |
|------------------|--------|----------------------|
| Rising | EM credit strength | Bullish for EEM — credit leads equities |
| Falling | EM credit stress | Bearish for EEM — watch for contagion |
| Sharp drop | EM crisis risk | Reduce EM equity exposure |

**When to use**: Leading indicator for EM equities. Credit often moves before stocks.

### Copper/Gold — Growth vs. Fear

The copper/gold ratio captures global growth expectations:

| Copper/Gold Behavior | Signal | International Implication |
|----------------------|--------|--------------------------|
| Rising | Global growth optimism | Favor EM, cyclical international |
| Falling | Fear/slowdown | Favor US, defensive positioning |

**When to use**: Macro confirmation. Rising copper/gold supports EM and commodity-linked international markets.

## Valuation signals

### The CAPE spread — US vs. International

The Shiller CAPE (Cyclically Adjusted Price-to-Earnings) ratio provides a long-term valuation lens:

| Market | Typical CAPE Range | Expensive | Cheap |
|--------|-------------------|-----------|-------|
| **US (SPY)** | 15-25 | >30 | <15 |
| **Developed ex-US (EFA)** | 12-20 | >25 | <15 |
| **Emerging Markets (EEM)** | 10-18 | >20 | <12 |

**The spread matters**: When US CAPE exceeds international CAPE by 15+ points, **mean reversion historically follows within 1-5 years**. This has happened before major international outperformance cycles (2000-2007, potentially 2025+).

| CAPE Spread (US minus Intl) | Historical Signal |
|-----------------------------|-------------------|
| +15 or more | Extreme — favor international |
| +5 to +15 | Elevated — international attractive |
| -5 to +5 | Neutral — fundamentals dominate |
| -5 or less | Rare — US relatively cheap |

**Current context**: As of mid-2025, US CAPE ~34 vs. developed international ~19 — a 15-point spread at historically extreme levels.

## Actionable strategies

### Strategy 1: Dollar Cycle Rotation

**Setup**: DXY breaks below major support after extended uptrend

**Entry**: Buy VEU or VXUS on DXY breakdown confirmation (weekly close below support)

**Management**:
- Add on pullbacks while DXY makes lower highs
- Monitor EFA/SPY for confirmation of international strength

**Exit**: DXY breaks above declining resistance, EFA/SPY breaks below rising support

### Strategy 2: Developed vs. Emerging Rotation

**Setup**: EFA/EEM at extreme (either direction)

**Entry**: 
- EFA/EEM at highs → Overweight EEM
- EFA/EEM at lows → Overweight EFA

**Management**: Hold for mean reversion (typically 6-18 months)

**Exit**: Ratio returns to middle of range

### Strategy 3: Valuation Mean Reversion

**Setup**: CAPE spread (US minus international) exceeds 15 points

**Entry**: Begin systematic allocation to international (monthly purchases)

**Management**:
- Patient — valuation mean reversion takes 2-5 years
- Dollar trend can accelerate or delay

**Exit**: CAPE spread normalizes (<10 points) or international valuations become extended

### Strategy 4: EM Credit Leading Signal

**Setup**: EMB/TLT breaks out from consolidation

**Entry**: Buy EEM on EMB/TLT breakout (credit leads equities)

**Management**:
- Hold while EMB/TLT trends higher
- Watch for divergences (EMB rolling over while EEM holds)

**Exit**: EMB/TLT breaks down, or EEM fails to follow credit strength

## Quick reference table

| Ratio | Rising Means | Falling Means | Primary Use |
|-------|--------------|---------------|-------------|
| **DXY** | Dollar strength (headwind) | Dollar weakness (tailwind) | Primary driver |
| **EFA/SPY** | Developed intl outperforming | US outperforming | Allocation signal |
| **EEM/SPY** | EM risk-on | EM risk-off | Risk appetite |
| **VEU/SPY** | Total intl outperforming | US outperforming | Broad allocation |
| **EFA/EEM** | Developed preferred | EM preferred | Within-intl allocation |
| **EMB/TLT** | EM credit strong | EM credit weak | EM leading indicator |

{{< callout type="tip" >}}
**The bottom line**: The dollar is the dominant driver of international equity returns for US investors. Watch DXY for the primary signal, use EFA/SPY and EEM/SPY for confirmation, and respect the long duration of these cycles. When valuation spreads are extreme and the dollar is weakening, international can outperform for years. When the dollar is strengthening and US growth leads, stay home.
