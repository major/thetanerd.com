weight: 20
---

Emerging markets offer exposure to faster-growing economies — but with significantly higher volatility, political risk, and currency swings. These markets have delivered spectacular gains during global growth cycles and devastating losses during crises. Understanding the ETF landscape — and the **China concentration problem** — is essential for sizing your EM allocation appropriately.

## The big two: EEM vs VWO

These are the dominant emerging market ETFs. Despite tracking similar universes, they differ in cost and methodology.

| ETF | Name | Expense Ratio | Holdings | AUM | Index |
|-----|------|---------------|----------|-----|-------|
| [**EEM**](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239637/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-etf) | iShares MSCI Emerging Markets | 0.70% | ~1,400 | ~$20B | MSCI Emerging Markets |
| [**VWO**](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vwo) | Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets | 0.08% | ~5,800 | ~$90B | FTSE Emerging Markets |
| [**IEMG**](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/244050/ishares-core-msci-emerging-markets-etf) | iShares Core MSCI EM | 0.09% | ~2,800 | ~$80B | MSCI EM Investable Market |

### EEM — The liquid benchmark

EEM is the **original emerging markets ETF** and remains the most liquid, with the best options market.

**Key characteristics:**
- **MSCI methodology**: Institutional benchmark standard
- **Large/mid-cap focus**: ~1,400 holdings
- **Best options liquidity**: Tightest spreads, most volume
- **Higher expense ratio**: 0.70% — reflects legacy pricing

**When to use EEM:**
- You need options for hedging or income strategies
- You're making large trades requiring maximum liquidity
- You're benchmarking against MSCI EM

**The trade-off:** Expensive. For long-term holding, cheaper alternatives exist.

### VWO — The low-cost alternative

VWO tracks the **FTSE Emerging Markets All Cap Index** at just **0.08%** — nearly 10x cheaper than EEM.

**Key characteristics:**
- **FTSE methodology**: Different country classifications than MSCI
- **Broader coverage**: ~5,800 holdings including small-caps
- **South Korea excluded**: FTSE classifies Korea as developed (unlike MSCI)
- **Vanguard scale**: Massive AUM, low trading costs

**When to use VWO:**
- Long-term buy-and-hold allocation
- You want the lowest possible expense ratio
- Korea exclusion is acceptable (it's in VEA instead)

**The trade-off:** Less liquid options market than EEM.

### IEMG — The middle ground

IEMG offers **MSCI methodology at near-Vanguard pricing** (0.09%).

**Key characteristics:**
- **MSCI Investable Market Index**: Includes small-caps (~2,800 holdings)
- **South Korea included**: Unlike VWO
- **Core series pricing**: Part of iShares' low-cost lineup
- **Growing AUM**: Now rivals VWO in assets

**When to use IEMG:**
- You want MSCI exposure for benchmark consistency
- You prefer Korea inclusion
- Core long-term allocation

### Comparing the three

| Factor | EEM | VWO | IEMG |
|--------|-----|-----|------|
| **Expense ratio** | 0.70% | **0.08%** | 0.09% |
| **Holdings** | ~1,400 | **~5,800** | ~2,800 |
| **South Korea** | Included | **Excluded** | Included |
| **Small-cap exposure** | Limited | **Yes** | Yes |
| **Options liquidity** | **Best** | Moderate | Moderate |
| **Index family** | MSCI | FTSE | MSCI |
| **Best for** | Trading, options | Long-term hold | Core allocation |

## The China problem

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
**China represents 25-30% of most emerging market ETFs.** This single-country concentration creates significant political, regulatory, and delisting risk.
{{< /callout >}}

### China weight in major EM ETFs

| ETF | China Weight | Implication |
|-----|--------------|-------------|
| **EEM** | ~25% | Heavy China exposure |
| **VWO** | ~28% | Even heavier (FTSE methodology) |
| **IEMG** | ~25% | Similar to EEM |

### Why China weight matters

| Risk | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Regulatory crackdowns** | Government actions on tech, education, real estate sectors |
| **Delisting risk** | US-listed Chinese ADRs could be forced to delist |
| **Geopolitical tension** | Taiwan, trade wars, sanctions |
| **Data transparency** | Less reliable corporate disclosures |
| **VIE structure** | Many Chinese ADRs don't represent actual ownership |

### Ex-China alternatives

If you want EM exposure without China concentration:

| ETF | Name | Expense Ratio | Focus |
|-----|------|---------------|-------|
| [**EMXC**](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf) | iShares MSCI EM ex-China | 0.25% | EM without China |
| [**XCEM**](https://www.columbiathreadneedleus.com/investment-products/etfs/columbia-em-core-ex-china-etf/) | Columbia EM Core ex-China | 0.16% | Lower-cost alternative |

**When to use ex-China:**
- You want to size China exposure separately
- You're concerned about China-specific risks
- You want to pair with a dedicated China ETF

## Country ETFs — Targeted exposure

For tactical bets on specific emerging economies:

### China

| ETF | Name | Expense Ratio | Focus |
|-----|------|---------------|-------|
| [**FXI**](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239536/ishares-china-largecap-etf) | iShares China Large-Cap | 0.74% | 50 largest Chinese companies (H-shares) |
| [**MCHI**](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239619/ishares-msci-china-etf) | iShares MSCI China | 0.59% | Broader China (~600 holdings) |
| [**KWEB**](https://www.kraneshares.com/kweb) | KraneShares CSI China Internet | 0.69% | Chinese tech/internet focus |
| [**CQQQ**](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?productId=CQQQ) | Invesco China Technology | 0.70% | Chinese tech sector |

**FXI vs MCHI**: FXI is concentrated (50 stocks, state-owned heavy). MCHI is broader and includes more private companies. KWEB/CQQQ for pure tech exposure.

### Brazil

| ETF | Name | Expense Ratio | Focus |
|-----|------|---------------|-------|
| [**EWZ**](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239612/ishares-msci-brazil-etf) | iShares MSCI Brazil | 0.59% | Broad Brazil (~50 holdings) |

**EWZ characteristics:**
- **High volatility**: BRL (Brazilian real) swings can be extreme
- **Commodity-linked**: Heavy energy, materials, financials
- **High dividend yield**: Often 5-8% yield
- **Political sensitivity**: Elections, Petrobras, fiscal policy

### India

| ETF | Name | Expense Ratio | Focus |
|-----|------|---------------|-------|
| [**INDA**](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239659/ishares-msci-india-etf) | iShares MSCI India | 0.64% | Broad India (~130 holdings) |
| [**EPI**](https://www.wisdomtree.com/investments/etfs/equity/epi) | WisdomTree India Earnings | 0.84% | Earnings-weighted India |
| [**SMIN**](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239763/ishares-msci-india-smallcap-etf) | iShares MSCI India Small-Cap | 0.79% | Indian small-caps |

**India characteristics:**
- **Fastest-growing large economy**: Demographics favorable
- **Less commodity-dependent**: Tech, financials, consumer focus
- **Relatively expensive**: Premium valuations vs. other EM
- **Currency volatility**: INR can swing meaningfully

### Taiwan & Korea

| ETF | Name | Expense Ratio | Focus |
|-----|------|---------------|-------|
| [**EWT**](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239675/ishares-msci-taiwan-etf) | iShares MSCI Taiwan | 0.59% | Taiwan (~90 holdings) |
| [**EWY**](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239681/ishares-msci-south-korea-etf) | iShares MSCI South Korea | 0.59% | South Korea (~100 holdings) |

**Semiconductor exposure**: Both Taiwan (TSMC) and Korea (Samsung) are heavily weighted toward semiconductors. These are essentially **leveraged bets on the global chip cycle**.

### Other notable EM countries

| ETF | Name | Expense Ratio | Country |
|-----|------|---------------|---------|
| [**EWW**](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239616/ishares-msci-mexico-etf) | iShares MSCI Mexico | 0.50% | Mexico — nearshoring beneficiary |

| [**EZA**](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239606/ishares-msci-south-africa-etf) | iShares MSCI South Africa | 0.59% | South Africa — commodity-linked |

## The EEM/SPY ratio — Key signal

The ratio of EEM to SPY shows **emerging market risk appetite**:

| EEM/SPY Behavior | Interpretation | Action |
|------------------|----------------|--------|
| Rising sharply | EM risk-on | Add emerging market exposure |
| Falling sharply | EM risk-off | Reduce EM, flight to quality |
| Breaking multi-year downtrend | Potential regime change | Watch for confirmation |
| Diverging from dollar | Warning | Dollar typically drives EM returns |

### What drives EM outperformance?

| Factor | Bullish for EM | Bearish for EM |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| **Dollar** | Weakening | Strengthening |
| **Commodities** | Rising | Falling |
| **Fed policy** | Cutting rates | Hiking rates |
| **Global growth** | Accelerating | Decelerating |
| **China** | Stimulus, reopening | Crackdowns, lockdowns |
| **Risk appetite** | High (VIX low) | Low (VIX elevated) |

## EM within international allocation

### EFA/EEM ratio — Developed vs Emerging

This ratio shows preference **within** international allocations:

| EFA/EEM Behavior | Interpretation | Action |
|------------------|----------------|--------|
| Rising | Defensive international | Overweight developed (EFA/VEA) |
| Falling | Aggressive international | Overweight emerging (EEM/VWO) |
| At extremes | Mean reversion likely | Consider fading the trend |

**Historical pattern**: EM tends to outperform developed during global growth accelerations and commodity bull markets. Developed tends to outperform during risk-off periods and dollar strength.

## Which ETF for which situation?

| Situation | Best Choice | Why |
|-----------|-------------|-----|
| Long-term core EM allocation | **VWO** or **IEMG** | Lowest cost, broad exposure |
| Options trading, hedging | **EEM** | Best liquidity, options market |
| EM without China risk | **EMXC** | Removes China concentration |
| China conviction (broad) | **MCHI** | Broader than FXI |
| China tech bet | **KWEB** | Pure internet/tech exposure |
| India growth bet | **INDA** | Fastest-growing large EM |
| Brazil yield/commodity | **EWZ** | High yield, commodity-linked |
| Semiconductor cycle bet | **EWT** or **EWY** | Taiwan/Korea chip exposure |

## Quick reference

| ETF | Type | Expense | Best For |
|-----|------|---------|----------|
| {{< badge content="VWO" color="blue" >}} | Core | 0.08% | Long-term hold, lowest cost |
| {{< badge content="IEMG" color="blue" >}} | Core | 0.09% | MSCI exposure, core allocation |
| {{< badge content="EEM" color="blue" >}} | Core | 0.70% | Trading, options, liquidity |
| {{< badge content="EMXC" color="green" >}} | Ex-China | 0.25% | EM without China |
| {{< badge content="MCHI" color="yellow" >}} | Country | 0.59% | Broad China exposure |
| {{< badge content="KWEB" color="yellow" >}} | Country | 0.69% | China tech/internet |
| {{< badge content="INDA" color="yellow" >}} | Country | 0.64% | India growth |
| {{< badge content="EWZ" color="yellow" >}} | Country | 0.59% | Brazil, high yield |
| {{< badge content="EWT" color="yellow" >}} | Country | 0.59% | Taiwan semiconductors |

{{< callout type="tip" >}}
**The bottom line:** For long-term EM exposure, VWO or IEMG offers the best value. Use EEM if you need options liquidity. Consider EMXC if China concentration concerns you — then size China separately with MCHI or FXI. Country ETFs are for tactical bets when you have specific views. Remember: EM is high-beta — position size accordingly.
