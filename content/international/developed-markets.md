weight: 10
---

Developed international markets — Europe, Japan, Australia, and other advanced economies — offer exposure to stable, dividend-paying companies outside the US. These markets tend to be **less volatile than emerging markets** but still provide diversification benefits and currency exposure. Understanding the ETF landscape helps you choose the right instrument for your allocation.

## The big three: EFA vs VEA vs IEFA

These are the core developed international ETFs. They track similar universes but differ in cost, methodology, and liquidity.

| ETF | Name | Expense Ratio | Holdings | AUM | Index |
|-----|------|---------------|----------|-----|-------|
| [**EFA**](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239623/ishares-msci-eafe-etf) | iShares MSCI EAFE | 0.32% | ~800 | ~$70B | MSCI EAFE |
| [**VEA**](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vea) | Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets | 0.03% | ~4,000 | ~$150B | FTSE Developed ex-US |
| [**IEFA**](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/244049/ishares-core-msci-eafe-etf) | iShares Core MSCI EAFE | 0.07% | ~2,800 | ~$120B | MSCI EAFE IMI |

### EFA — The liquid benchmark

EFA tracks the **MSCI EAFE Index** (Europe, Australasia, Far East) — the original international developed market benchmark. It's the most widely traded and has the tightest bid-ask spreads.

**Key characteristics:**
- **Large/mid-cap focus**: ~800 holdings, larger companies only
- **MSCI methodology**: The index that institutional investors benchmark against
- **Excludes Canada**: Unlike VEA, which includes it
- **Options liquidity**: Best options market among developed international ETFs

**When to use EFA:**
- You need maximum liquidity for large trades
- You want to trade options on developed international exposure
- You're benchmarking against MSCI EAFE (institutional standard)

**The trade-off:** Higher expense ratio (0.32%) than alternatives.

### VEA — The low-cost leader

VEA tracks the **FTSE Developed All Cap ex-US Index** and charges just **0.03%** — the lowest in the category.

**Key characteristics:**
- **Broadest coverage**: ~4,000 holdings including small-caps
- **Includes Canada**: Unlike EAFE-based ETFs
- **FTSE methodology**: Slightly different country classifications than MSCI
- **Vanguard scale**: Massive AUM keeps trading costs low

**When to use VEA:**
- Long-term buy-and-hold allocation
- You want the lowest possible expense ratio
- You prefer broader small-cap exposure
- Canada inclusion is acceptable (or desired)

**The trade-off:** Less liquid options market than EFA.

### IEFA — The middle ground

IEFA tracks the **MSCI EAFE Investable Market Index (IMI)** — the same countries as EFA but including small-caps.

**Key characteristics:**
- **MSCI methodology** with small-cap inclusion (~2,800 holdings)
- **Low cost**: 0.07% — nearly as cheap as VEA
- **Excludes Canada**: Like EFA
- **Core series**: Part of iShares' low-cost Core lineup

**When to use IEFA:**
- You want MSCI exposure (for consistency with benchmarks) but at low cost
- You prefer small-cap inclusion without switching to FTSE methodology
- Long-term core holding

### Comparing the three

| Factor | EFA | VEA | IEFA |
|--------|-----|-----|------|
| **Expense ratio** | 0.32% | **0.03%** | 0.07% |
| **Holdings** | ~800 | **~4,000** | ~2,800 |
| **Small-cap exposure** | No | **Yes** | Yes |
| **Canada included** | No | **Yes** | No |
| **Options liquidity** | **Best** | Moderate | Moderate |
| **Index family** | MSCI | FTSE | MSCI |
| **Best for** | Trading, options | Long-term hold | Core allocation |

## Geographic breakdown

Developed international markets are concentrated in three regions:

| Region | Approximate Weight | Key Countries |

| **Japan** | ~20% | Single largest country exposure |
| **Pacific ex-Japan** | ~10% | Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore |

The top 5 countries typically represent 60-70% of developed international exposure:

## The EFA/SPY ratio — Key signal

The ratio of EFA to SPY is the **primary signal** for developed international allocation:

| EFA/SPY Behavior | Interpretation | Action |
|------------------|----------------|--------|
| Breaking multi-year downtrend | Regime change to international | Increase EFA/VEA allocation |
| Making higher highs | Developed outperformance confirmed | Hold/add positions |
| Making lower lows | US leadership continues | Underweight developed international |
| Rising while DXY falls | Dollar weakness driving returns | Expect continued tailwind |

### What drives developed market outperformance?

| Factor | Bullish for Developed | Bearish for Developed |
|--------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Dollar** | Weakening | Strengthening |
| **Valuations** | Cheap vs. US (CAPE spread wide) | Expensive vs. US |
| **European growth** | Accelerating | Decelerating |
| **BOJ policy** | Normalizing (yen strength) | Ultra-loose (yen weakness) |
| **Global trade** | Expanding | Contracting |

## Which ETF for which situation?

| Situation | Best Choice | Why |
|-----------|-------------|-----|
| Long-term core allocation | **VEA** | Lowest cost, broadest coverage |
| MSCI benchmark tracking | **IEFA** | MSCI methodology at low cost |
| Active trading, options | **EFA** | Best liquidity, options market |
| Europe overweight | **VGK** | Low cost, broad Europe |
| Eurozone conviction | **FEZ** | Concentrated large-cap euro exposure |
| Japan overweight | **EWJ** or **BBJP** | Direct Japan, BBJP is cheaper |
| Dollar strength hedge | **HEDJ** or **DXJ** | Currency-hedged versions |

## Quick reference

| ETF | Type | Expense | Best For |
|-----|------|---------|----------|
| {{< badge content="VEA" color="blue" >}} | Core | 0.03% | Long-term hold, lowest cost |
| {{< badge content="IEFA" color="blue" >}} | Core | 0.07% | MSCI exposure, core allocation |
| {{< badge content="EFA" color="blue" >}} | Core | 0.32% | Trading, options, liquidity |
| {{< badge content="VGK" color="green" >}} | Regional | 0.08% | Europe tilt |
| {{< badge content="FEZ" color="green" >}} | Regional | 0.29% | Eurozone large-cap |
| {{< badge content="EWJ" color="green" >}} | Regional | 0.50% | Japan tilt |
| {{< badge content="HEDJ" color="yellow" >}} | Hedged | 0.58% | Europe, currency hedged |
| {{< badge content="DXJ" color="yellow" >}} | Hedged | 0.48% | Japan, currency hedged |

{{< callout type="tip" >}}
**The bottom line:** For most investors, VEA offers the best combination of low cost and broad exposure for a long-term developed international allocation. Use EFA if you need options liquidity or are benchmarking against MSCI. Regional ETFs (VGK, EWJ) are for tactical tilts when you have a specific view. Currency-hedged ETFs (HEDJ, DXJ) make sense when you expect dollar strength.
