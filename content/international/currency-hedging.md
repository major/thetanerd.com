For US-based investors, international equity returns have two components: **local market returns** and **currency translation**. When the dollar weakens, you get a tailwind. When it strengthens, you face a headwind. Currency-hedged ETFs remove this FX exposure — giving you pure local returns. But hedging has costs and trade-offs. This page explains when to hedge and when to embrace currency exposure.

## How currency affects international returns

### The math of unhedged returns

When you buy an unhedged international ETF (like EFA or VEU), your return in USD equals:

**USD Return ≈ Local Return + Currency Return**

| Scenario | Local Return | Currency Move | Your USD Return |
|----------|--------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Both positive | +10% | EUR/USD +5% | **~+15%** |
| Local up, dollar up | +10% | EUR/USD -5% | **~+5%** |
| Local down, dollar down | -10% | EUR/USD +5% | **~-5%** |
| Both negative | -10% | EUR/USD -5% | **~-15%** |

**Key insight:** Currency moves can **double your gains or losses**. In 2022, a strong dollar wiped out gains for US investors in international stocks. In 2017, a weak dollar added to returns.

### The DXY as a signal

The **DXY (US Dollar Index)** is the single most important indicator for currency hedging decisions:

| DXY Trend | Currency Impact | Hedging Recommendation |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Downtrend** (falling) | Tailwind for unhedged | **Don't hedge** — capture currency gains |
| **Uptrend** (rising) | Headwind for unhedged | **Consider hedging** — avoid currency drag |
| **Range-bound** | Neutral | Either approach works |
| **Sharp spike** (risk-off) | Headwind | Hedging helps short-term |

## Currency-hedged ETFs

These ETFs use currency forwards to neutralize FX exposure, giving you local market returns only:

### Developed markets hedged

| ETF | Name | Expense Ratio | Region | Unhedged Equivalent |
|-----|------|---------------|--------|---------------------|
| [**DBEF**](https://www.xtrackers.com/us/en/product-detail/DBEF) | Xtrackers MSCI EAFE Hedged | 0.35% | Developed ex-US | EFA |
| [**HEFA**](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275382/ishares-currency-hedged-msci-eafe-etf) | iShares Currency Hedged MSCI EAFE | 0.35% | Developed ex-US | EFA |
| [**HEDJ**](https://www.wisdomtree.com/investments/etfs/equity/hedj) | WisdomTree Europe Hedged Equity | 0.58% | Europe only | VGK |
| [**DXJ**](https://www.wisdomtree.com/investments/etfs/equity/dxj) | WisdomTree Japan Hedged Equity | 0.48% | Japan only | EWJ |

### Emerging markets hedged

| ETF | Name | Expense Ratio | Region |
|-----|------|---------------|--------|
| [**DBEM**](https://www.xtrackers.com/us/en/product-detail/DBEM) | Xtrackers MSCI EM Hedged | 0.65% | Emerging markets |
| [**HEEM**](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275385/ishares-currency-hedged-msci-emerging-markets-etf) | iShares Currency Hedged MSCI EM | 0.70% | Emerging markets |

{{< callout type="info" >}}
**EM hedging is less common** — emerging market currencies are more volatile and harder to hedge efficiently. Most investors accept EM currency risk as part of the EM thesis.

## Hedged vs unhedged: the trade-offs

### Costs of hedging

| Cost | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Higher expense ratio** | Typically 0.20-0.35% more than unhedged |
| **Roll costs** | Currency forwards must be rolled, creating drag |
| **Interest rate differential** | If foreign rates < US rates, hedging costs money |
| **Tracking error** | Hedging isn't perfect — small mismatches occur |

**Current context:** When US rates are higher than foreign rates (as in 2023-2025), hedging has a **negative carry cost**. You're effectively paying to hedge.

### When hedging wins

| Scenario | Why Hedging Helps |
|----------|------------------|
| Dollar strengthening | Avoids currency drag on returns |
| High conviction on local markets | Isolates local return, removes FX noise |
| Short holding period | Reduces volatility from currency swings |
| Tactical trade | Pure bet on local market direction |

### When unhedged wins

| Scenario | Why Unhedged Helps |
|----------|-------------------|
| Dollar weakening | Captures currency translation gains |
| Long holding period (10+ years) | Currency effects tend to mean-revert |
| Diversification goal | Currency adds diversification benefit |
| Lower cost | Avoid hedging expense and roll costs |

## Historical performance comparison

### 2014-2016: Hedging won

The dollar surged ~25% against major currencies. Hedged ETFs massively outperformed:

| Period | EFA (Unhedged) | DBEF (Hedged) |
|--------|----------------|---------------|
| 2014 | -4.5% | **+4.8%** |
| 2015 | -0.8% | **+5.6%** |
| 2016 | +1.0% | +0.7% |

### 2017: Unhedged won

The dollar weakened ~10%. Unhedged ETFs captured the tailwind:

| Period | EFA (Unhedged) | DBEF (Hedged) |
|--------|----------------|---------------|
| 2017 | **+25.0%** | +16.8% |

### 2020-2021: Mixed

Dollar volatile but ultimately weakened:

| Period | Unhedged Performance |
|--------|---------------------|
| 2020 | Unhedged slightly better |
| 2021 | Mixed, dollar choppy |

### 2022: Hedging helped

Dollar surged to 20-year highs:

| Period | EFA (Unhedged) | DBEF (Hedged) |
|--------|----------------|---------------|
| 2022 | -14.4% | **-8.2%** |

### 2023-2025: Unhedged winning

Dollar peaked and weakened:

| Period | Trend | Winner |
|--------|-------|--------|
| 2023-2024 | Dollar peaked | Mixed |
| 2025 YTD | Dollar falling | **Unhedged** |

## The hedging decision framework

### Short-term (< 1 year)

| DXY Trend | Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Rising / Breaking out | **Hedge** (HEDJ, DBEF, DXJ) |
| Falling / Breaking down | **Don't hedge** (EFA, VEA) |
| Range-bound | Preference / cost matters |

### Long-term (5+ years)

| View | Recommendation |
|------|----------------|
| No strong dollar view | **Don't hedge** — currency noise averages out, save on costs |
| Structural dollar bull | Consider partial hedge |
| Structural dollar bear | **Don't hedge** — capture tailwind |

### The blend approach

If uncertain, you can split allocation:

| Approach | Example |
|----------|---------|
| 50/50 blend | Half EFA, half DBEF |
| Tactical core | 70% unhedged (VEA), 30% hedged (DBEF) |
| Regional hedge | Hedge Europe (HEDJ), leave Japan unhedged (EWJ) |

## Regional hedging strategies

### Europe (HEDJ)

HEDJ hedges EUR and other European currencies against USD.

**When to use HEDJ:**
- You're bullish on European stocks but bearish on EUR
- Dollar is strengthening vs. EUR
- You want pure European equity exposure without FX noise

**HEDJ characteristics:**
- **Dividend-weighted**: Unlike cap-weighted EFA
- **Expense ratio**: 0.58% (higher than VGK at 0.08%)
- **Yield focus**: Higher dividend exposure than market-cap approaches

### Japan (DXJ)

DXJ hedges JPY against USD.

**When to use DXJ:**
- You're bullish on Japanese stocks but bearish on yen
- BOJ policy is ultra-loose (yen weakness expected)
- You want to isolate Japanese equity returns

**DXJ characteristics:**
- **Dividend-weighted**: Like HEDJ
- **Expense ratio**: 0.48%
- **Yen sensitivity**: When yen weakens, DXJ tends to outperform EWJ

### The yen carry trade connection

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
**Yen weakness often correlates with global risk-on.** When the yen carry trade is working (borrow yen, invest in higher-yielding assets), DXJ benefits. When carry trades unwind (yen spikes), DXJ can underperform EWJ.

## Which hedged ETF for which situation?

| Situation | Best Choice | Why |
|-----------|-------------|-----|
| Broad developed, dollar rising | **DBEF** or **HEFA** | Hedged EAFE exposure |
| Europe conviction, dollar rising | **HEDJ** | Europe-specific hedge |
| Japan conviction, yen weak | **DXJ** | Japan-specific hedge |
| EM with hedge | **DBEM** | Rare use case, high cost |
| Long-term hold | **EFA/VEA (unhedged)** | Currency mean reverts, save costs |
| Uncertain about dollar | **Blend approach** | Split hedged/unhedged |

## Quick reference

| ETF | Region | Expense | Hedge? | Use When |
|-----|--------|---------|--------|----------|
| {{< badge content="DBEF" color="blue" >}} | EAFE | 0.35% | Yes | Dollar rising, broad developed |
| {{< badge content="HEFA" color="blue" >}} | EAFE | 0.35% | Yes | Alternative to DBEF (iShares) |
| {{< badge content="HEDJ" color="green" >}} | Europe | 0.58% | Yes | Dollar rising vs EUR |
| {{< badge content="DXJ" color="green" >}} | Japan | 0.48% | Yes | Yen weakness expected |
| {{< badge content="EFA" color="yellow" >}} | EAFE | 0.32% | No | Dollar falling, long-term |
| {{< badge content="VEA" color="yellow" >}} | Dev ex-US | 0.03% | No | Long-term, lowest cost |

{{< callout type="tip" >}}
**The bottom line:** Currency hedging is a **tactical decision**, not a permanent one. When the dollar is strengthening, hedged ETFs protect returns. When the dollar is weakening, unhedged ETFs capture the tailwind. For long-term investors without a strong dollar view, unhedged is usually fine — currency effects tend to mean-revert and hedging costs add up. Watch DXY for signals, and don't overthink it: the local market return usually matters more than the currency component over time.
