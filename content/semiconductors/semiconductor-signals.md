The semiconductor sector offers powerful **relative strength signals** for the entire market. As the picks-and-shovels of the AI revolution, chips lead economic cycles, tech rotations, and growth/value shifts. By monitoring ratios between semiconductor ETFs, the broader market, and related sectors, traders can identify inflection points before they show up in headlines.

This page consolidates the key relative charts and trading signals across the semiconductor complex into a single dashboard.

## The semiconductor sector hierarchy

Semiconductors aren't monolithic — different segments respond differently to economic conditions:

| Segment | Examples | Cycle Sensitivity | What Drives It |
|---------|----------|-------------------|----------------|
| **AI/Data Center Chips** | NVIDIA, AMD, Broadcom | High | AI capex, cloud spending |
| **Memory** | Micron, SK Hynix | Very High | Supply/demand cycles, pricing |
| **Foundry/Manufacturing** | TSMC, Intel Foundry | Moderate | Capacity utilization, capex |
| **Equipment** | ASML, LRCX, AMAT, KLAC | High | Fab buildouts, capex cycles |
| **Analog/Power** | Texas Instruments, ON Semi | Moderate | Industrial, auto demand |
| **Mobile/Consumer** | Qualcomm, MediaTek | Moderate | Smartphone cycles |

Understanding this hierarchy is key: **not all semiconductor stocks move together**, and the ETFs weight these segments differently.

## Essential relative charts

### SMH/SPY — Semiconductors vs. Market

The foundational ratio for understanding semiconductor sector leadership:

| SMH/SPY Behavior | Signal | Interpretation |
|------------------|--------|----------------|
| Strong uptrend | Tech leadership | Growth/AI trade working, risk-on |
| Breaking down | Rotation out | Value/defensives preferred, risk-off |
| Diverging from QQQ | Sector-specific | Semi-specific catalyst (earnings, AI news) |
| At 52-week highs | Extended | Watch for mean reversion |

**When to use**: Macro regime identification. Rising SMH/SPY = semiconductor leadership, growth trade working.

### SMH/QQQ — Semiconductors vs. Tech

Shows whether semis are leading or lagging within the tech sector:

| SMH/QQQ Behavior | Signal | Interpretation |
|------------------|--------|----------------|
| Rising | Semi leadership | AI/chip cycle accelerating |
| Falling | Broad tech preferred | Software, mega-caps leading |
| Breaking out | Inflection | New semi cycle beginning |
| Breaking down | Rotation | Semi cycle maturing, rotate to software |

**When to use**: Within-tech allocation. This tells you whether to overweight semis vs. broader tech.

### XSD/SMH — Small-Cap vs. Mega-Cap Semis

The **key ratio** for measuring semiconductor market breadth:

| XSD/SMH Behavior | Condition | Action |
|------------------|-----------|--------|
| Rising | Breadth expanding | Small-caps participating — healthy rally |
| Falling | Narrow leadership | Mega-caps only — watch for exhaustion |
| Breaking out | Risk-on | Overweight XSD for higher beta |
| Breaking down | Flight to quality | Stick with SMH, reduce XSD |

**When to use**: Breadth assessment. XSD/SMH rising = broad participation, sustainable rally.

### SOXX/XLK — Semiconductors vs. Broad Tech

Compares pure semiconductor exposure to the broader technology sector:

| SOXX/XLK Behavior | Signal | Interpretation |
|-------------------|--------|----------------|
| Rising | Semis outperforming | Hardware > software, AI capex cycle |
| Falling | Software leading | SaaS, cloud software preferred |
| At extremes | Mean reversion | Ratio tends to revert over 1-2 years |

**When to use**: Sector rotation within tech. Helps time software vs. hardware allocation.

### SMH/XLI — Semiconductors vs. Industrials

Compares growth (semis) to cyclical value (industrials):

| SMH/XLI Behavior | Signal | Interpretation |
|------------------|--------|----------------|
| Rising | Growth leadership | Tech/AI preferred over old economy |
| Falling | Value rotation | Industrial capex, reshoring plays |
| Inflecting | Regime change | Major growth/value shift underway |

**When to use**: Growth vs. value timing. Major inflections in this ratio signal regime changes.

## Cross-asset signals

### SMH/GLD — Semiconductors vs. Gold

Compares the ultimate growth asset to the ultimate fear asset:

| SMH/GLD Behavior | Signal | Interpretation |
|------------------|--------|----------------|
| Rising | Risk-on | Growth and innovation preferred |
| Falling | Risk-off | Fear, uncertainty, flight to safety |
| At extremes | Sentiment extreme | Potential mean reversion setup |

**Historical context**: This ratio captures the growth/fear spectrum. Extreme readings often precede reversals.

### SMH/TLT — Semiconductors vs. Long Bonds

Shows the growth vs. duration trade:

| SMH/TLT Behavior | Signal | Interpretation |
|------------------|--------|----------------|
| Rising | Growth preferred | Risk-on, duration avoided |
| Falling | Safety bid | Flight to duration, growth sold |
| Both falling | Risk-off panic | Broad deleveraging |
| Both rising | Goldilocks | Growth with falling rates |

**When to use**: Macro regime confirmation. The relationship between chips and bonds reveals risk appetite.

### SMH/USO — Semiconductors vs. Oil

Compares new economy (chips) to old economy (energy):

| SMH/USO Behavior | Signal | Interpretation |
|------------------|--------|----------------|
| Rising | Tech dominance | Growth/innovation leading |
| Falling | Commodity cycle | Energy, inflation trades working |
| Decoupling | Sector-specific | Watch for divergent catalysts |

**When to use**: New vs. old economy positioning. Extended readings often revert.

## Actionable strategies

### Strategy 1: Sector Rotation

**Setup**: SMH/SPY breaking out from consolidation after underperformance

**Entry**: Buy SMH (or SOXX) on breakout confirmation

**Management**: 
- Add on pullbacks to 20-day MA
- Watch XSD/SMH for breadth confirmation

**Exit**: SMH/SPY breaks below 50-day MA

### Strategy 2: Breadth Expansion Trade

**Setup**: XSD/SMH bottoming after extended period of mega-cap dominance

**Entry**: Buy XSD when ratio breaks above 20-day MA

**Thesis**: Breadth expanding, small-caps catching up to mega-caps

**Management**:
- Hold while XSD/SMH rising
- Take profits when ratio reaches prior resistance

**Exit**: XSD/SMH breaks below entry level

### Strategy 3: AI Cycle Trade

**Setup**: NVIDIA earnings beat + raised guidance + SMH/QQQ breaking out

**Entry**: Buy SMH on earnings confirmation

**Management**:
- Trail stop at 21-day EMA
- Add on subsequent AI capex announcements

**Exit**: SMH/QQQ rolls over, AI narrative questioned

### Strategy 4: Mean Reversion

**Setup**: SMH/SPY at multi-year extremes (2+ standard deviations)

**Entry**: Fade the extreme when momentum indicators diverge

**Thesis**: Extended ratios tend to revert

**Exit**: Ratio returns to mean (50-day or 200-day MA of ratio)

## Quick reference table

| Ratio | Rising Means | Falling Means | Primary Use |
|-------|--------------|---------------|-------------|
| **SMH/SPY** | Semi leadership | Rotation out | Sector allocation |
| **SMH/QQQ** | Semis > broad tech | Software leading | Within-tech allocation |
| **XSD/SMH** | Breadth expanding | Narrow leadership | Market health |
| **SOXX/XLK** | Hardware > software | Software cycle | Tech rotation |
| **SMH/XLI** | Growth > value | Value rotation | Regime identification |
| **SMH/GLD** | Risk-on | Risk-off | Sentiment |
| **SMH/TLT** | Growth > duration | Safety bid | Macro regime |

{{< callout type="tip" >}}
**The bottom line**: Semiconductors are the market's growth barometer. When SMH/SPY is rising, growth is working. When XSD/SMH is rising, the rally has breadth. When both are falling, it's time to be defensive. Monitor these ratios weekly and let them guide your semiconductor allocation.
