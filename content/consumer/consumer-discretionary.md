description: "XLY, VCR, FDIS, and RSPD compared — choosing the right discretionary exposure"
---

Consumer discretionary stocks represent what people *want* to buy — cars, restaurants, hotels, luxury goods. The sector is highly sensitive to consumer confidence and employment. When the economy is strong, discretionary spending soars; when it weakens, these stocks feel it first.

## Core ETFs compared

| ETF | Expense | Holdings | Weighting | AUM |
|-----|---------|----------|-----------|-----|
| [**XLY**](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/intermediary/etfs/funds/the-consumer-discretionary-select-sector-spdr-fund-xly) | 0.09% | ~50 | Cap-weighted | ~$15B |
| [**VCR**](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/VCR) | 0.10% | ~300 | Cap-weighted | ~$5B |
| [**FDIS**](https://www.fidelity.com/etfs/investing-ideas/consumer-discretionary-etf) | 0.08% | ~260 | Cap-weighted | ~$2B |
| [**RSPD**](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&productId=ETF-RSPD) | 0.40% | ~50 | Equal-weighted | — |

## The concentration problem

All cap-weighted discretionary ETFs share heavy mega-cap concentration:

| Holding | XLY | VCR | FDIS |
|---------|-----|-----|------|
| Amazon | ~22% | ~25% | ~23% |
| Tesla | ~17% | ~14% | ~15% |
| Top 10 | ~60% | ~55% | ~55% |

A 10% Amazon drop = ~2.2% hit to XLY. You're not getting broad discretionary exposure — you're getting Amazon + Tesla + some other stuff.

## RSPD — The equal-weight alternative

RSPD solves concentration by giving every stock equal weight:

| Factor | XLY | RSPD |
|--------|-----|------|
| Amazon weight | ~22% | ~2% |
| Tesla weight | ~17% | ~2% |
| Top 10 weight | ~60% | ~20% |
| Expense | 0.09% | 0.40% |

**RSPD outperforms when:** Breadth expanding, smaller stocks catching up, volatility elevated  
**RSPD underperforms when:** Mega-caps leading, quality flight, low volatility

## Which ETF when?

| Situation | Best Choice |
|-----------|-------------|
| Options trading | XLY (best liquidity) |
| Long-term, cost-focused | FDIS (0.08%) |
| Broad diversification | VCR (~300 holdings) |
| Reduce mega-cap concentration | RSPD |
| High conviction on AMZN/TSLA | XLY |
