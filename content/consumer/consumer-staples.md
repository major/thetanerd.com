description: "Comparing XLP, VDC, and FSTA — the core consumer staples ETFs, plus equal-weight alternatives for defensive positioning"
---

Consumer staples stocks represent **what people need to buy** — regardless of economic conditions. Food, beverages, household products, toiletries, tobacco. This makes the sector inherently defensive: people don't stop buying toothpaste or groceries during recessions. When markets get volatile, staples often hold up while discretionary names collapse.

## The Big Three: XLP vs VDC vs FSTA

These are the core consumer staples ETFs that most traders use. Understanding their differences helps you choose the right defensive exposure.

| ETF | Name | Expense Ratio | Weighting | Holdings | AUM |

| [**FSTA**](https://www.fidelity.com/etfs/investing-ideas/consumer-staples-etf) | Fidelity MSCI Consumer Staples | 0.08% | Market-cap weighted | ~100 | ~$1.3B |

### Comparing the Three

| Factor | XLP | VDC | FSTA |
|--------|-----|-----|------|
| **Expense Ratio** | 0.08% | 0.10% | 0.08% |
| **Holdings** | ~40 | ~100 | ~100 |

## Why Staples Are Defensive

Consumer staples have historically provided:

| Characteristic | Why It Matters |
|----------------|----------------|
| **Lower beta** | Less volatile than the market (beta ~0.6-0.7) |
| **Steady earnings** | Demand is consistent regardless of economy |
| **Dividend yield** | Higher yield than growth sectors (~2.5-3%) |
| **Recession resistance** | Essential spending continues during downturns |
| **Inflation hedge** | Pricing power on branded products |

### The Trade-Off

Staples typically **underperform during bull markets**. When risk appetite is high, money flows to growth and cyclicals. Staples get left behind.

| Market Environment | Staples Behavior |
|--------------------|------------------|
| Bull market, risk-on | Underperform (laggard) |
| Bear market, risk-off | Outperform (safe haven) |
| High volatility | Relative stability |
| Rising rates | Mixed (higher yields compete) |
| Recession | Outperform significantly |

## RSPS — The Equal-Weight Alternative

[**RSPS**](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&productId=ETF-RSPS) (Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Consumer Staples) gives every stock the same weight, removing concentration in Walmart and Costco.

| ETF | Name | Expense Ratio | Weighting | Holdings |
|-----|------|---------------|-----------|----------|
| **RSPS** | Invesco S&P 500 EW Consumer Staples | 0.40% | Equal-weighted | ~40 |

### How RSPS Differs

| Factor | XLP (Cap-Weight) | RSPS (Equal-Weight) |
|--------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Walmart weight** | ~11% | ~2.5% |
| **Costco weight** | ~10% | ~2.5% |
| **Top 10 weight** | ~65% | ~25% |
| **Expense ratio** | 0.08% | 0.40% |
| **Rebalancing** | Market-driven | Quarterly |

### When RSPS Makes Sense

- You want broader staples exposure without retail dominance
- You believe smaller staples names will catch up
- You're pairing with RSPD for equal-weight consumer ratio analysis
- You want more exposure to food/beverage producers vs. retailers

### The RSPS/XLP Ratio

The ratio of RSPS to XLP shows whether **breadth is expanding within staples**:

| RSPS/XLP Behavior | Signal | Interpretation |
|-------------------|--------|----------------|
| Rising | Breadth expanding | Smaller staples outperforming |
| Falling | Concentration increasing | Walmart/Costco leading |
| Stable | Neutral | No clear preference |

## Subsector Exposure

Consumer staples contains several distinct subsectors:

| Subsector | Key Stocks in XLP | Characteristics |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Food & Staples Retail** | Walmart, Costco | High volume, thin margins, scale advantages |
| **Beverages** | Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Constellation | Brand power, pricing power, global reach |
| **Food Products** | General Mills, Kraft Heinz, Mondelez | Branded packaged goods |
| **Household Products** | P&G, Colgate, Clorox | Essential products, brand loyalty |
| **Tobacco** | Philip Morris, Altria | High yield, declining volumes, regulatory risk |
| **Personal Care** | Estée Lauder, Church & Dwight | Premium vs. value dynamics |

### The Walmart/Costco Question

Walmart and Costco together represent ~20% of XLP. These are **retailers**, not product manufacturers:

- **Walmart**: Value-focused, trade-down beneficiary during recessions
- **Costco**: Membership model, higher-income customer base

Their inclusion makes XLP somewhat different from "pure" staples exposure. They behave more like hybrid retail/staples.

## Staples as Risk-Off Signal

The XLP/SPY ratio is a key **defensive rotation indicator**:

| XLP/SPY Behavior | Market Signal |
|------------------|---------------|
| Rising sharply | Fear, risk-off rotation |
| Steady rise | Deteriorating risk appetite |
| Falling | Risk-on, growth preferred |
| At multi-year lows | Maximum complacency |

### Historical Context

XLP tends to outperform SPY during:
- 2008 Financial Crisis
- 2020 COVID crash (initially)
- 2022 bear market
- Recessionary periods

XLP tends to underperform during:
- 2017 low-volatility bull market
- 2020-2021 post-COVID rally
- Strong growth-led advances

## Yield Comparison

Consumer staples are known for dividends. Here's how the ETFs compare:

| ETF | Approximate Yield | Yield Characteristic |
|-----|-------------------|----------------------|
| **XLP** | ~2.5-2.8% | Reliable, slow-growing |
| **VDC** | ~2.4-2.7% | Similar to XLP |
| **FSTA** | ~2.4-2.7% | Similar to XLP |
| **RSPS** | ~2.0-2.5% | Lower due to equal-weight |

**Note**: Yields vary with price. Higher staples prices = lower yields. During risk-off periods when staples rally, yields compress.

## Which ETF for Which Situation?

| Situation | Best Choice | Why |
|-----------|-------------|-----|
| **Options trading** | XLP | Best liquidity, tightest spreads |
| **Long-term defensive holding** | XLP or FSTA | Lowest expense ratios |
| **Broader diversification** | VDC or FSTA | More holdings |
| **Equal-weight preference** | RSPS | Removes Walmart/Costco dominance |
| **Yield focus** | XLP | Highest liquidity, reliable dividends |
| **Tactical risk-off trade** | XLP | Most liquid for quick rotation |

## Key Ratios to Monitor

| Ratio | What It Tells You |
|-------|-------------------|
| **XLP/SPY** | Defensive rotation — staples vs. market |
| **XLY/XLP** | Risk sentiment — discretionary vs. defensive |
| **RSPS/RSP** | Staples vs. equal-weight S&P — sector preference |
| **XLP/TLT** | Staples vs. bonds — equity defensive vs. duration |
| **XLP/GLD** | Staples vs. gold — defensive equity vs. hard asset |

## Quick Reference

| ETF | Type | Expense | Best For |
|-----|------|---------|----------|
| {{< badge content="XLP" color="blue" >}} | Core | 0.08% | Trading, options, tactical defense |
| {{< badge content="VDC" color="blue" >}} | Core | 0.10% | Long-term diversified holding |
| {{< badge content="FSTA" color="green" >}} | Core | 0.08% | Lowest cost broad holding |
| {{< badge content="RSPS" color="yellow" >}} | Equal-Weight | 0.40% | Reduced retail concentration |

{{< callout type="tip" >}}
**The bottom line:** Consumer staples are your defensive anchor. When risk-off hits, XLP tends to hold up better than the market. For most traders, XLP is the default choice due to liquidity. For long-term holders, FSTA offers the same low cost with broader diversification. Use XLP/SPY rising as a warning signal — when staples start outperforming, something is making investors nervous.
