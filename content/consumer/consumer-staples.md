description: "XLP, VDC, FSTA, and RSPS compared — choosing the right defensive exposure"
---

Consumer staples stocks represent what people *need* to buy — food, beverages, household products, toiletries. The sector is inherently defensive: people don't stop buying toothpaste during recessions. When markets get volatile, staples hold up while discretionary names collapse.

## Core ETFs compared

| ETF | Expense | Holdings | Weighting | AUM |
|-----|---------|----------|-----------|-----|
| [**XLP**](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/intermediary/etfs/funds/the-consumer-staples-select-sector-spdr-fund-xlp) | 0.08% | ~40 | Cap-weighted | ~$15B |
| [**VDC**](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/VDC) | 0.10% | ~100 | Cap-weighted | ~$8.5B |
| [**FSTA**](https://www.fidelity.com/etfs/investing-ideas/consumer-staples-etf) | 0.08% | ~100 | Cap-weighted | ~$1.3B |
| [**RSPS**](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&productId=ETF-RSPS) | 0.40% | ~40 | Equal-weighted | — |

## Top holdings (XLP)

| Stock | Weight |
|-------|--------|
| Walmart (WMT) | ~11% |
| Costco (COST) | ~10% |
| Procter & Gamble (PG) | ~9% |
| Coca-Cola (KO) | ~6% |
| PepsiCo (PEP) | ~5% |

Staples are more diversified than discretionary — top holdings are 10-12% vs 20%+ for XLY.

## Why staples are defensive

| Characteristic | Why It Matters |
|----------------|----------------|
| Lower beta (~0.6-0.7) | Less volatile than market |
| Steady earnings | Demand consistent regardless of economy |
| Dividend yield (~2.5-3%) | Higher than growth sectors |
| Recession resistance | Essential spending continues |

**The trade-off:** Staples typically underperform during bull markets when money flows to growth.

## RSPS — The equal-weight alternative

RSPS removes Walmart/Costco dominance:

| Factor | XLP | RSPS |
|--------|-----|------|
| Walmart weight | ~11% | ~2.5% |
| Costco weight | ~10% | ~2.5% |
| Top 10 weight | ~65% | ~25% |
| Expense | 0.08% | 0.40% |

Use RSPS when you want more exposure to food/beverage producers vs. retailers.

## Which ETF when?

| Situation | Best Choice |
|-----------|-------------|
| Options trading | XLP (best liquidity) |
| Long-term defensive | XLP or FSTA (0.08%) |
| Broader diversification | VDC or FSTA (~100 holdings) |
| Reduce retail concentration | RSPS |
| Tactical risk-off trade | XLP |

## Yield comparison

| ETF | Approximate Yield |
|-----|-------------------|
| XLP | ~2.5-2.8% |
| VDC | ~2.4-2.7% |
| FSTA | ~2.4-2.7% |
| RSPS | ~2.0-2.5% |

Yields vary with price — when staples rally during risk-off, yields compress.
