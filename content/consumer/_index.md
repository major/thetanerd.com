The consumer sector is the market's real-time economic health monitor. Consumer Discretionary (XLY) represents what people *want* to buy — cars, restaurants, luxury goods. Consumer Staples (XLP) represents what people *need* to buy — food, household products, toiletries. The ratio between them is one of the most powerful risk sentiment indicators available.
