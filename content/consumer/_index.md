The consumer sector is the market's real-time economic health monitor. Consumer Discretionary (XLY) represents what people *want* to buy — cars, restaurants, travel, luxury goods. Consumer Staples (XLP) represents what people *need* to buy — food, household products, toiletries. The ratio between them is one of the most powerful risk sentiment indicators available.

When consumers feel confident about jobs and income, they spend on discretionary items. When they're worried, they pull back to essentials. This behavioral shift shows up in relative ETF performance before it shows up in economic data.
