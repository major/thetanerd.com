The ratio between Consumer Discretionary (XLY) and Consumer Staples (XLP) is a real-time economic health monitor. When consumers feel confident, they spend on wants; when worried, they retreat to needs. This behavioral shift shows up in ETF prices before economic reports.

## The XLY/XLP ratio

This is the foundational ratio for understanding consumer sentiment and market risk appetite.

| XLY/XLP Behavior | Signal | Interpretation |
|------------------|--------|----------------|
| Strong uptrend | Risk-on | Consumer confidence high, expansion |
| Breaking to new highs | Acceleration | Bull market confirmation |
| Rolling over from highs | Caution | Confidence waning, potential rotation |
| Sharp decline | Risk-off | Defensive rotation, recession concerns |
| Bottoming after decline | Potential turn | Watch for cycle change |

### The 1.20 threshold

When XLY/XLP spikes above **1.20**, it often signals short-term overbought conditions:

| Timeframe | Avg S&P 500 Return After XLY/XLP > 1.20 |
|-----------|------------------------------------------|
| 1 month | -0.82% (caution) |
| 3 months | Returns improve |
| 6-12 months | Normalize to average |

Extreme consumer strength can signal short-term exhaustion while long-term health remains intact.

## Key relative charts

### XLY/SPY — Discretionary vs. Market

| Behavior | Signal |
|----------|--------|
| Rising | Consumer leadership, risk appetite strong |
| Falling | Rotation to defensive or value |
| Diverging from SPY highs | Warning — rally lacks consumer participation |

### XLP/SPY — Staples vs. Market

| Behavior | Signal |
|----------|--------|
| Rising | Defensive rotation, risk-off |
| Spiking sharply | Panic rotation to safety |
| At multi-year lows | Maximum risk-on, potential warning |

### XRT/XLY — Retail breadth

XRT is equal-weighted; XLY is dominated by Amazon/Tesla. This ratio reveals breadth:

| Behavior | Signal |
|----------|--------|
| Rising | Breadth expanding, smaller retailers participating |
| Falling | Mega-cap dominance, narrow leadership |

When XRT diverges negatively while XLY holds up, only mega-caps are masking weakness.

### RSPD/RSPS — Equal-weight consumer ratio

Removes mega-cap distortion from the discretionary/staples comparison:

| Behavior | Signal |
|----------|--------|
| Rising with XLY/XLP | Confirmed risk-on with broad participation |
| Diverging from XLY/XLP | Warning — mega-caps masking weakness |
