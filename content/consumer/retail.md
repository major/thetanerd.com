description: "XRT, PEJ, IBUY, and ONLN — retail subsector ETFs for pure-play exposure to brick-and-mortar, e-commerce, and leisure spending"
---

Retail ETFs offer **targeted exposure** to specific consumer spending channels — brick-and-mortar stores, e-commerce platforms, restaurants, and leisure. Unlike broad consumer discretionary ETFs dominated by Amazon and Tesla, retail-focused funds provide exposure to the breadth of consumer spending behavior.

## The Retail Landscape

Retail isn't monolithic. Different retail segments respond to different economic drivers:

| Segment | Key ETF | Economic Driver | Sensitivity |
|---------|---------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Broad Retail** | XRT | Consumer spending, employment | Very High |
| **Leisure & Dining** | PEJ | Experiences, travel, dining out | Very High |
| **Online Retail** | IBUY, ONLN | E-commerce adoption, tech trends | High |
| **Specialty Retail** | Embedded in XLY | Housing, fashion, discretionary | High |

## XRT — The Retail Breadth Play

[**XRT**](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/intermediary/etfs/funds/spdr-sp-retail-etf-xrt) (SPDR S&P Retail ETF) is the most widely traded retail-specific ETF and offers a fundamentally different exposure than XLY.

| Attribute | XRT | XLY |
|-----------|-----|-----|
| **Weighting** | Equal-weight | Market-cap weight |
| **Amazon exposure** | ~1-2% | ~22% |
| **Tesla exposure** | 0% | ~17% |
| **Holdings** | ~80 | ~50 |
| **Expense ratio** | 0.35% | 0.09% |
| **Focus** | Pure retail | Broad discretionary |

### Why XRT Matters

XRT's **equal-weight methodology** is its superpower:

1. **Every retailer counts equally**: Dollar Tree has the same weight as Amazon
2. **Small-cap tilt**: Smaller retailers have meaningful impact
3. **Breadth signal**: When XRT outperforms XLY, it means the *average* retailer is doing well, not just Amazon

### XRT Top Holdings (Equal-Weighted)

Because XRT is equal-weighted, holdings shift with rebalancing. Typical constituents include:

| Category | Example Stocks |
|----------|----------------|
| **Department Stores** | Macy's, Kohl's, Nordstrom |
| **Specialty Retail** | Best Buy, AutoZone, O'Reilly |
| **Apparel** | Gap, TJX, Ross Stores |
| **Home Improvement** | Home Depot, Lowe's |
| **E-Commerce** | Amazon (small weight), eBay |
| **Grocery** | Kroger, Sprouts |
| **Discount** | Dollar General, Dollar Tree |

### XRT/XLY Ratio — The Breadth Signal

This ratio is **critical** for understanding consumer health:

| XRT/XLY Behavior | Signal | Interpretation |
|------------------|--------|----------------|
| Rising | Breadth expanding | Average retailer catching up to mega-caps |
| Falling | Concentration | AMZN/TSLA carrying the sector |
| Breaking out | Risk-on | Broad retail participation, healthy consumer |
| Breaking down | Warning | Only largest names working |

**Key insight**: During healthy consumer environments, XRT and XLY move together. When XRT diverges negatively while XLY holds up, it's a warning that only mega-caps are masking weakness.

### When to Use XRT

| Situation | Why XRT |
|-----------|---------|
| Breadth bet | Equal-weight captures broad retail health |
| Earnings season | Individual retailer earnings move XRT more |
| Holiday retail play | Broad exposure to holiday spending |
| Mean reversion | After mega-cap outperformance |
| Higher beta | More volatile than XLY |

## PEJ — Leisure & Entertainment

[**PEJ**](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&productId=ETF-PEJ) (Invesco Dynamic Leisure and Entertainment ETF) targets companies that benefit from **experiential spending** — travel, dining, entertainment, and leisure.

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Expense Ratio** | 0.55% |
| **Holdings** | ~30 |
| **Methodology** | Dynamic (multi-factor) |
| **Focus** | Experiences over goods |

### PEJ Sector Exposure

| Subsector | Weight | Examples |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| **Hotels & Resorts** | ~25-30% | Marriott, Hilton, Wyndham |
| **Restaurants** | ~20-25% | McDonald's, Chipotle, Darden |
| **Casinos & Gaming** | ~15-20% | Las Vegas Sands, MGM, Wynn |
| **Entertainment** | ~10-15% | Disney, Live Nation |
| **Travel** | ~10% | Booking, Expedia |

### When PEJ Shines

PEJ tends to outperform when:
- **Post-pandemic recovery**: Pent-up demand for experiences
- **Strong employment**: People have money and time to travel/dine
- **Low gas prices**: Travel becomes more affordable
- **Holiday/vacation seasons**: Seasonal spending peaks

PEJ tends to underperform when:
- **Recession fears**: Experiences are cut first
- **High inflation**: Dining/travel costs pressure demand
- **Health concerns**: COVID-style shutdowns
- **High gas prices**: Travel demand drops

### PEJ as Economic Signal

The leisure sector is **extremely cyclical**. Rising PEJ/SPY suggests consumers are confident enough to spend on experiences — a bullish economic signal.

| PEJ/SPY Behavior | Signal |
|------------------|--------|
| Rising | Consumer confidence strong, experiential spending up |
| Falling | Belt-tightening, cutting discretionary experiences |

## IBUY — Online Retail (Amplify)

## Seasonal Patterns

Retail ETFs exhibit notable seasonality:

| Season | Typical Pattern |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Q4 (Holiday)** | Strongest quarter; earnings guidance critical |
| **January** | Post-holiday hangover, markdown season |
| **Spring (Q2)** | Back-to-school prep begins |
| **Summer** | Leisure spending peaks (PEJ), retail transitions |

### Earnings Season Impact

Because XRT is equal-weighted, individual retailer earnings move the ETF more than in XLY:

| Event | Impact on XRT |
|-------|---------------|
| **Walmart beats** | Moderate (equal weight) |
| **Small retailer beats** | Same as Walmart (equal weight) |
| **Amazon beats** | Minimal direct impact (~1-2% weight) |
| **Broad retail misses** | Significant (broad exposure) |

## Which ETF for Which Situation?

| Situation | Best Choice | Why |
|-----------|-------------|-----|
| **Retail breadth bet** | XRT | Equal-weight, average retailer exposure |
| **Holiday shopping play** | XRT | Broad retail, seasonal spending |
| **Leisure/travel recovery** | PEJ | Experiential spending focus |
| **E-commerce secular growth** | IBUY | Diversified online retail |
| **Concentrated e-commerce** | ONLN | Largest online players |
| **Higher beta consumer** | XRT | More volatile than XLY |
| **Options trading** | XRT | Best liquidity among retail-focused |

## Key Ratios Summary

| Ratio | What It Tells You |
|-------|-------------------|
| **XRT/XLY** | Retail breadth vs. mega-cap concentration |
| **XRT/SPY** | Retail sector leadership |
| **PEJ/SPY** | Experiential spending strength |
| **IBUY/XRT** | Online vs. offline preference |
| **XRT/XLP** | Cyclical retail vs. defensive staples |

{{< callout type="tip" >}}
**The bottom line:** XRT is your go-to for pure retail exposure without Amazon/Tesla dominance. Use XRT/XLY to measure breadth — when it's rising, the average retailer is participating. Add PEJ for leisure/experiential exposure and IBUY for secular e-commerce trends. These subsector plays give you surgical precision compared to the blunt instrument of XLY.
