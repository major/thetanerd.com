description: "XRT, PEJ, IBUY, and ONLN compared — targeted retail subsector exposure"
---

Retail ETFs offer targeted exposure to specific consumer spending channels — brick-and-mortar, e-commerce, restaurants, and leisure. Unlike XLY (dominated by Amazon/Tesla), retail-focused funds capture the breadth of consumer spending behavior.

## Core ETFs compared

| ETF | Focus | Expense | Holdings | Amazon Weight |
|-----|-------|---------|----------|---------------|
| [**XRT**](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/intermediary/etfs/funds/spdr-sp-retail-etf-xrt) | Broad retail | 0.35% | ~80 | ~1-2% |
| [**PEJ**](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&productId=ETF-PEJ) | Leisure/dining | 0.55% | ~30 | 0% |
| [**IBUY**](https://amplifyetfs.com/ibuy/) | E-commerce | 0.65% | ~60-80 | ~8-10% |
| [**ONLN**](https://www.proshares.com/our-etfs/thematic-investing/onln) | E-commerce | 0.58% | ~25 | ~25% |

## XRT — The breadth play

XRT's **equal-weight methodology** is its superpower:

- Every retailer counts equally — Dollar Tree = Amazon
- Small-cap tilt — smaller retailers have meaningful impact  
- Breadth signal — when XRT outperforms XLY, the *average* retailer is doing well

| XRT vs XLY | XRT | XLY |
|------------|-----|-----|
| Weighting | Equal | Cap-weighted |
| Amazon | ~1-2% | ~22% |
| Tesla | 0% | ~17% |
| Holdings | ~80 | ~50 |

## PEJ — Experiential spending

PEJ targets companies benefiting from experiences over goods:

| Subsector | Weight | Examples |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Hotels & Resorts | ~25-30% | Marriott, Hilton |
| Restaurants | ~20-25% | McDonald's, Chipotle |
| Casinos & Gaming | ~15-20% | MGM, Wynn |
| Entertainment | ~10-15% | Disney, Live Nation |
