Security spending — both digital and physical — follows its own cycle driven by threat landscapes, government budgets, and geopolitical tensions. Cybersecurity companies protect networks and data from hackers, while aerospace and defense contractors build the missiles, aircraft, and systems that protect nations. Despite their differences, these sectors often move together when the world feels less safe.

Understanding when to favor digital security (CIBR) versus physical defense (ITA) — and when both are working — helps traders position for the security trade before headlines drive prices.
