The security sector — both digital (cybersecurity) and physical (aerospace & defense) — offers unique **relative strength signals** tied to threat perception, government spending, and geopolitical tension. By monitoring ratios between CIBR, ITA, and the broader market, traders can identify when security spending is accelerating before it shows up in earnings.

This page consolidates the key relative charts and trading signals across the security complex into a single dashboard.

## The security sector hierarchy

Security isn't monolithic — digital and physical defense respond to different catalysts:

| Segment | ETF | Primary Driver | Correlation to Geopolitics |
|---------|-----|----------------|---------------------------|
| **Cybersecurity** | CIBR | Commercial + government IT spending | Moderate — spikes on breaches |
| **Aerospace & Defense** | ITA | Government defense budgets | High — direct geopolitical link |
| **Defense (equal-weight)** | XAR | Same as ITA, less concentrated | High |
| **Space & Satellites** | UFO | Military + commercial space | Moderate-high |

Understanding this hierarchy is key: **cyber and defense don't always move together**, and their divergence tells a story.

## Essential relative charts

### CIBR/SPY — Cybersecurity vs. Market

The foundational ratio for cybersecurity sector leadership:

| CIBR/SPY Behavior | Signal | Interpretation |
|-------------------|--------|----------------|
| Strong uptrend | Cyber leadership | Security spending outpacing market growth |
| Breaking out | Sector rotation | Capital flowing into cybersecurity |
| Breaking down | Risk-off or rotation out | Growth sectors struggling, or cyber-specific headwinds |
| Spike on breach news | Event-driven | High-profile attack driving awareness |

**When to use**: Sector allocation timing. Rising CIBR/SPY = cybersecurity outperforming, security spending thesis working.

### ITA/SPY — Aerospace & Defense vs. Market

Shows whether defense is attracting capital:

| ITA/SPY Behavior | Signal | Interpretation |
|------------------|--------|----------------|
| Rising | Defense rotation | Geopolitical concerns, budget increases |
| Falling | Risk-on elsewhere | Growth/tech preferred over defense |
| Spike | Conflict escalation | Immediate geopolitical event |
| Grinding higher | Sustained spending | Defense budget cycle in expansion |

**When to use**: Geopolitical sentiment gauge. Rising ITA/SPY = market pricing in defense spending increases.

### CIBR/ITA — Cyber vs. Physical Defense

The **key ratio** for understanding which type of security is favored:

| CIBR/ITA Behavior | Condition | Interpretation |
|-------------------|-----------|----------------|
| Rising | Digital over physical | Cyber threats prioritized, commercial IT spending strong |
| Falling | Physical over digital | Traditional defense favored, military spending focus |
| At extremes | Mean reversion setup | Ratio tends to oscillate over 6-12 months |
| Breaking out | Regime shift | Sustained preference for one over the other |

**When to use**: Within-sector allocation. This tells you whether to overweight cyber (CIBR) or defense (ITA).

{{< callout type="info" >}}
**Key insight**: CIBR/ITA often rises after major cyber breaches (SolarWinds, Colonial Pipeline) as cyber spending accelerates. It falls when kinetic conflicts escalate (Ukraine, Middle East tensions) and defense budgets surge.
{{< /callout >}}

### XAR/ITA — Equal-Weight vs. Cap-Weight Defense

Shows breadth within the defense sector:

| XAR/ITA Behavior | Signal | Interpretation |
|------------------|--------|----------------|
| Rising | Breadth expanding | Smaller contractors participating, broad strength |
| Falling | Mega-caps leading | Flight to quality, narrow leadership |
| Breaking out | Risk-on within defense | Overweight XAR for higher beta |
| Breaking down | Concentration working | Stick with ITA for mega-cap safety |

**When to use**: Risk assessment within defense. XAR/ITA rising = healthy broad participation.

### CIBR/QQQ — Cybersecurity vs. Tech

Compares cybersecurity to the broader tech sector:

| CIBR/QQQ Behavior | Signal | Interpretation |
|-------------------|--------|----------------|
| Rising | Cyber leading tech | Security spending outpacing general tech |
| Falling | Broad tech preferred | AI/cloud/software leading over security |
| Diverging | Sector-specific move | Cyber catalyst (breach, regulation) |

**When to use**: Within-tech allocation. Helps decide between security-focused tech exposure vs. broad tech.

### ITA/XLI — Defense vs. Industrials

Shows defense leadership within the industrial sector:

| ITA/XLI Behavior | Signal | Interpretation |
|------------------|--------|----------------|
| Rising | Defense leading industrials | Geopolitical premium, defense budget focus |
| Falling | Broad industrials preferred | Infrastructure, manufacturing over defense |
| Breaking out | Defense cycle accelerating | Overweight defense within industrials |

**When to use**: Sector rotation within industrials. Defense often leads when geopolitical risk rises.

## Cross-asset signals

### CIBR/GLD — Cybersecurity vs. Gold

Compares growth-oriented security spending to fear-driven gold:

| CIBR/GLD Behavior | Signal | Interpretation |
|-------------------|--------|----------------|
| Rising | Growth over fear | Risk-on, tech/growth preferred |
| Falling | Fear over growth | Risk-off, gold as safe haven |
| Both rising | Security bid across assets | Broad security theme working |

**When to use**: Risk sentiment confirmation. CIBR/GLD falling while ITA/GLD rising = physical security favored over digital.

### ITA/TLT — Defense vs. Long Bonds

Shows risk appetite between defense stocks and safe-haven bonds:

| ITA/TLT Behavior | Signal | Interpretation |
|------------------|--------|----------------|
| Rising | Defense preferred | Risk-on, equities over duration |
| Falling | Safety bid | Flight to treasuries |
| Both falling | Broad risk-off | Deleveraging across assets |

**When to use**: Macro regime confirmation. Defense usually outperforms bonds when risk appetite is healthy.

## Geopolitical triggers

### Event-Driven Signals

| Event Type | CIBR Impact | ITA Impact | Duration |
|------------|-------------|------------|----------|
| Major cyber breach | Spike ↑ | Neutral | 1-4 weeks |
| Ransomware attack on infrastructure | Spike ↑ | Moderate ↑ | 2-6 weeks |
| Military conflict escalation | Neutral to ↓ | Spike ↑ | Weeks to months |
| Defense budget increase | Moderate ↑ | Strong ↑ | Sustained |
| Cybersecurity regulation | Moderate ↑ | Neutral | Sustained |
| Peace negotiations | Neutral | May decline | Variable |

### The Breach Trade

High-profile cyber breaches create predictable patterns:

1. **Day 0-3**: CIBR spikes on news (fear trade)
2. **Week 1-2**: Consolidation as details emerge
3. **Week 3-8**: Budget reallocations begin (sustained move)
4. **Month 2+**: New baseline established

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
**Timing matters**: The initial spike is often a poor entry. The sustainable move comes from actual budget increases, which take weeks to materialize in guidance.
{{< /callout >}}

### The Conflict Trade

Military conflicts follow different timing:

1. **Day 0-1**: ITA spikes immediately on escalation news
2. **Week 1-2**: Retracement as initial fear fades
3. **Month 1-3**: Budget discussions drive sustained moves
4. **Quarter 2+**: Contract awards validate thesis

## Actionable strategies

### Strategy 1: Breach Response Trade

**Setup**: Major cyber breach announced + CIBR/SPY spiking

**Entry**: Wait for 3-5 day consolidation, buy on first higher low

**Thesis**: Initial spike is fear; sustained move comes from budget reallocation

**Management**:
- Trail stop at 21-day EMA
- Watch for earnings guidance confirmations

**Exit**: CIBR/SPY breaks below entry-day low or rolls over on high volume

### Strategy 2: Geopolitical Escalation Trade

**Setup**: Military conflict escalation + ITA/SPY breaking out

**Entry**: Buy ITA (or XAR for lower concentration) on breakout confirmation

**Management**:
- Add on pullbacks to 20-day MA
- Monitor defense budget news

**Exit**: ITA/SPY breaks 50-day MA or peace negotiations announced

### Strategy 3: Cyber vs. Defense Rotation

**Setup**: CIBR/ITA at extreme (1-year high or low)

**Entry**: Fade the extreme — buy lagging sector when ratio reverses

**Thesis**: The two sectors tend to mean-revert relative to each other

**Management**:
- Hold for 2-4 weeks minimum
- Watch for catalyst that could extend the trend

**Exit**: CIBR/ITA returns to 50-day moving average of the ratio

### Strategy 4: Equal-Weight Breadth Expansion

**Setup**: XAR/ITA bottoming after extended period of mega-cap leadership

**Entry**: Buy XAR when ratio breaks above 20-day MA

**Thesis**: Smaller defense contractors catching up to mega-caps

**Management**:
- Hold while XAR/ITA rising
- Take profits at prior resistance levels

**Exit**: XAR/ITA breaks below entry level

## Quick reference table

| Ratio | Rising Means | Falling Means | Primary Use |
|-------|--------------|---------------|-------------|
| **CIBR/SPY** | Cyber outperforming | Market preferred | Sector allocation |
| **ITA/SPY** | Defense outperforming | Market preferred | Sector allocation |
| **CIBR/ITA** | Cyber over defense | Defense over cyber | Within-security allocation |
| **XAR/ITA** | Breadth expanding | Mega-caps leading | Risk assessment |
| **CIBR/QQQ** | Cyber over tech | Broad tech preferred | Tech rotation |
| **ITA/XLI** | Defense over industrials | Broad industrials | Sector rotation |

{{< callout type="tip" >}}
**The bottom line**: Security spending follows threat perception. Cyber breaches drive CIBR, military tensions drive ITA. The CIBR/ITA ratio tells you which type of threat the market is pricing. Use XAR/ITA to assess breadth within defense. Monitor these ratios weekly and let them guide your security allocation.
