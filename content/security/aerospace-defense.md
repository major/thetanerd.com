description: "Comparing ITA, XAR, PPA, and alternatives — defense contractors, commercial aerospace, leveraged options, and space ETFs"
---

Aerospace and defense spending follows geopolitical cycles, government budgets, and global threat perceptions. Unlike cybersecurity's commercial focus, this sector depends heavily on government contracts — providing stability but also concentration risk. The choice between cap-weighted (ITA), equal-weighted (XAR), and modified approaches (PPA) significantly affects your exposure and risk profile.

For trading signals and relative charts, see [Security & Defense Signals]({{< ref "security-signals" >}}).

## The Big Three: ITA vs XAR vs PPA

These are the core aerospace and defense ETFs. Understanding their weighting differences is crucial.

| ETF | Name | Expense Ratio | Weighting | Holdings | AUM |
|-----|------|---------------|-----------|----------|-----|
| [**ITA**](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239502/ishares-us-aerospace-defense-etf) | iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense | 0.40% | Market-cap weighted | ~40 | ~$12B |
| [**XAR**](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/spdr-sp-aerospace-defense-etf-xar) | SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense | 0.35% | Equal-weighted | ~40-42 | ~$4.5B |
| [**PPA**](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PPA) | Invesco Aerospace & Defense | 0.58% | Modified market-cap | ~57-60 | ~$6.5B |

### ITA — The Mega-Cap Play

ITA is the **largest and most liquid** aerospace & defense ETF, but also the most concentrated.

- **Index**: Dow Jones U.S. Select Aerospace & Defense Index
- **Methodology**: Market-cap weighted with 22.5% individual cap
- **Top 10 concentration**: ~76% of the fund
- **Sector breakdown**: ~99% Aerospace & Defense

**Top holdings:**
| Holding | Weight |
|---------|--------|
| GE Aerospace (GE) | ~21% |
| RTX Corporation (RTX) | ~15% |
| Boeing (BA) | ~8% |
| Lockheed Martin (LMT) | ~5% |
| L3Harris Technologies (LHX) | ~5% |

**When to use ITA:**
- You want maximum liquidity for active trading
- You're bullish on mega-cap defense primes (GE, RTX, Boeing)
- You want the largest AUM and tightest spreads
- You're comfortable with high concentration risk

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
**Concentration risk**: GE Aerospace alone is ~21% of ITA. If GE stumbles, ITA feels it disproportionately. When Boeing had production issues, ITA underperformed XAR significantly.
{{< /callout >}}

### XAR — The Equal-Weight Alternative

XAR offers **dramatically lower concentration** by equal-weighting all holdings, giving smaller defense contractors equal voice.

- **Index**: S&P Aerospace & Defense Select Industry Index
- **Methodology**: Equal-weighted, rebalanced quarterly
- **Top 10 concentration**: ~38-45% (vs. ITA's 76%)
- **Largest holding**: ~4.5% (vs. ITA's 21%)

**When to use XAR:**
- You want diversification across the defense sector
- You're concerned about single-stock risk (Boeing volatility, GE concentration)
- You believe smaller defense contractors will outperform
- You want the **lowest expense ratio** (0.35%)

**The trade-off:** Higher turnover (35%) due to quarterly rebalancing. Slightly lower liquidity than ITA.

### PPA — The Balanced Approach

PPA uses a **modified market-cap weighting** that reduces concentration while maintaining some size tilt.

- **Index**: SPADE Defense Index
- **Methodology**: Modified cap-weight ("TrueCap") — reduces conglomerate overweighting
- **Top 10 concentration**: ~56% (between ITA and XAR)
- **Holdings**: 57-60 (broadest coverage)

**Top holdings:**
| Holding | Weight |
|---------|--------|
| RTX Corporation (RTX) | ~7-8% |
| GE Aerospace (GE) | ~7-8% |
| Boeing (BA) | ~7-8% |
| Lockheed Martin (LMT) | ~6-7% |
| Northrop Grumman (NOC) | ~5% |

**When to use PPA:**
- You want balanced exposure between mega-caps and mid-caps
- You prefer more holdings for broader diversification
- You're comfortable with higher expense ratio (0.58%)
- You want the oldest A&D ETF (launched 2005)

**The trade-off:** Highest expense ratio among the big three. Modified weighting is less transparent than pure cap or equal weight.

## Comparing the Three

| Factor | ITA | XAR | PPA |
|--------|-----|-----|-----|
| **Top 10 Concentration** | ~76% | ~38-45% | ~56% |
| **Largest Single Holding** | ~21% | ~4.5% | ~7-8% |
| **Expense Ratio** | 0.40% | 0.35% | 0.58% |
| **Holdings** | ~40 | ~40-42 | ~57-60 |
| **AUM** | ~$12B | ~$4.5B | ~$6.5B |
| **Liquidity** | Highest | Moderate | Moderate |
| **Small/Mid-Cap Exposure** | Low | High | Moderate |
| **Best For** | Mega-cap exposure | Diversification | Balanced approach |

### The XAR/ITA Ratio — A Key Signal

The ratio of XAR to ITA tells you whether **equal-weight or cap-weight** is leading:

- **XAR/ITA rising**: Smaller defense contractors outperforming — breadth expanding, risk-on within defense
- **XAR/ITA falling**: Mega-caps leading — flight to quality, narrow leadership

This ratio is particularly useful when assessing single-stock risk. When Boeing or GE faces headwinds, XAR/ITA tends to rise as equal-weight avoids the concentration hit.

## Leveraged Options

{{< callout type="error" >}}
**Warning**: Leveraged ETFs are for short-term trading only. Daily rebalancing causes significant decay over time. These can lose money even when the underlying index is flat.
{{< /callout >}}

### DFEN — 3x Leveraged A&D

| ETF | Name | Leverage | Expense Ratio | Index |
|-----|------|----------|---------------|-------|
| [**DFEN**](https://www.direxion.com/product/daily-aerospace-defense-bull-3x-etf) | Direxion Daily Aerospace & Defense Bull 3X | +3x daily | 0.97% | Dow Jones U.S. Select A&D |

DFEN is the **only leveraged option** in the aerospace & defense space.

**Key mechanics:**
- Tracks same index as ITA with 3x daily leverage
- Daily reset creates path dependency
- Volatility decay erodes value in choppy markets
- AUM: ~$285 million

**When traders use DFEN:**
- Short-term directional bets (days, not weeks)
- Trading around defense budget announcements or geopolitical events
- Expressing high-conviction views on defense spending

**When to avoid DFEN:**
- Multi-week holds (decay is real)
- Uncertain market direction
- As a core portfolio holding

## Defense Technology ETFs

### SHLD — Global X Defense Tech ETF

| ETF | Name | Expense Ratio | Focus |
|-----|------|---------------|-------|
| [**SHLD**](https://www.globalxetfs.com/funds/shld/) | Global X Defense Tech ETF | 0.50% | Defense technology companies |

SHLD focuses on **emerging defense technologies** rather than traditional contractors:

- Emphasis on innovation and tech-forward defense
- Includes AI, autonomous systems, and next-gen weaponry
- Newer fund (launched 2023) with growth orientation
- Lower expense ratio than PPA, higher than XAR

**When to use SHLD:**
- You want defense exposure with technology tilt
- You believe defense innovation will outperform traditional contractors
- You prefer growth-oriented defense plays

## Space & Satellite ETFs

The militarization of space has created a new category bridging defense and space exploration.

| ETF | Name | Expense Ratio | Focus | Defense Overlap |
|-----|------|---------------|-------|-----------------|
| [**UFO**](https://www.intrepidcapital.com/etf-trust/ufo/) | Procure Space ETF | 0.75% | Pure-play space economy | Moderate |
| [**ROKT**](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/spdr-sp-kensho-final-frontiers-etf-rokt) | SPDR S&P Kensho Final Frontiers | 0.45% | Space + ocean exploration | ~50% |
| [**ARKX**](https://ark-funds.com/funds/arkx/) | ARK Space Exploration & Innovation | 0.75% | Disruptive space innovation | Low-moderate |

### UFO — Pure-Play Space

UFO offers the **most focused space exposure**, including:
- Satellite technology and infrastructure
- Rocket manufacturing (Rocket Lab, etc.)
- Space communications
- Government defense investment in space

**Top holdings include:**
- AST SpaceMobile (ASTS)
- Rocket Lab (RKLB)
- Traditional defense contractors with space divisions (Lockheed, RTX, Northrop)

**Performance**: Up 45%+ in 2025, driven by government defense investment and geopolitical competition.

### ROKT — Final Frontiers

ROKT provides **space exposure with significant defense overlap**:
- 61% Industrials, 30% Technology
- ~50%+ weight in traditional aerospace & defense companies
- Includes both space AND ocean exploration
- Cheaper than UFO (0.45% vs 0.75%)

**When to use ROKT:**
- You want space exposure without abandoning defense contractors
- You prefer lower expense ratios
- You want broader "frontier" exposure

### ARKX — Innovation Play

ARKX is **actively managed** by ARK Invest:
- Focuses on disruptive space innovation
- Includes commercial space, not just defense
- ARK's signature high-growth, high-volatility approach
- Less defense-focused than UFO or ROKT

## Fundamental drivers

### Government Defense Budgets

Defense spending is the primary driver:

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| U.S. defense budget increases | Bullish — primary revenue source |
| NATO spending commitments | Bullish — European rearmament |
| Geopolitical tensions | Bullish — accelerates procurement |
| Budget sequestration/cuts | Bearish — contract uncertainty |

### Commercial Aerospace Cycles

ITA and XAR include commercial aerospace exposure:

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Airline fleet renewals | Bullish for Boeing, suppliers |
| Travel demand recovery | Bullish for commercial aerospace |
| Boeing production issues | Bearish (especially for ITA) |
| Supply chain constraints | Mixed — delays but backlog remains |

### Geopolitical Events

| Event Type | Typical Impact |
|------------|----------------|
| Conflict escalation | Bullish — defense spending accelerates |
| Peace negotiations | Mixed — may reduce urgency |
| Ally defense commitments | Bullish — expanded market |
| Sanctions on defense exports | Bearish — market access reduced |

## Key ratios to monitor

For detailed signal interpretation, see [Security & Defense Signals]({{< ref "security-signals" >}}).

| Ratio | What It Measures | Quick Interpretation |
|-------|------------------|---------------------|
| **ITA/SPY** | Defense vs. market | Rising = defense outperforming |
| **XAR/ITA** | Equal-weight vs. cap-weight | Rising = breadth expanding |
| **ITA/XLI** | Defense vs. industrials | Rising = defense leading within sector |
| **CIBR/ITA** | Cyber vs. physical defense | Rising = digital security favored |

## Common mistakes

### Mistake 1: Ignoring concentration risk in ITA

GE Aerospace at 21% and RTX at 15% means ~36% of ITA is in just two stocks. If your thesis is "defense spending will rise," XAR gives you that exposure without the single-stock risk.

### Mistake 2: Holding DFEN for more than a few days

Leveraged ETF decay is real. A 10% up, 10% down sequence leaves you down ~9% in DFEN, not flat. Use it for directional bets measured in days, not weeks.

### Mistake 3: Treating space ETFs as defense proxies

While UFO and ROKT have defense contractor overlap, they include commercial space companies with different risk profiles. Pure defense exposure requires ITA, XAR, or PPA.

### Mistake 4: Chasing after geopolitical headlines

Defense stocks often spike on conflict news, then retrace. The sustainable move comes from **actual budget increases**, not headline fear.

## Which ETF for which situation?

| Situation | Best Choice | Why |
|-----------|-------------|-----|
| Core long-term defense exposure | XAR | Diversification, lowest fees |
| Maximum liquidity for trading | ITA | Largest AUM, tightest spreads |
| Balanced approach | PPA | Modified weighting, broadest holdings |
| Mega-cap conviction | ITA | Concentrated in GE, RTX, Boeing |
| Reducing Boeing/GE risk | XAR | Equal-weight limits single-stock exposure |
| Short-term directional trade | DFEN | 3x leverage (days only) |
| Defense technology focus | SHLD | Tech-forward defense exposure |
| Space + defense | ROKT | 50%+ defense overlap, lower fees |
| Pure space economy | UFO | Most focused space exposure |

## Quick reference

| ETF | Type | Expense | Best For |
|-----|------|---------|----------|
| {{< badge content="ITA" color="blue" >}} | Core | 0.40% | Mega-cap, liquidity |
| {{< badge content="XAR" color="blue" >}} | Core | 0.35% | Diversification, low fees |
| {{< badge content="PPA" color="blue" >}} | Core | 0.58% | Balanced approach |
| {{< badge content="DFEN" color="red" >}} | Leveraged | 0.97% | 3x bull, short-term only |
| {{< badge content="SHLD" color="green" >}} | Alternative | 0.50% | Defense technology |
| {{< badge content="UFO" color="green" >}} | Space | 0.75% | Pure-play space economy |
| {{< badge content="ROKT" color="green" >}} | Space | 0.45% | Space + defense overlap |

{{< callout type="tip" >}}
**The bottom line:** For most investors, XAR provides the best risk-adjusted defense exposure with its equal-weight approach and lowest fees. Use ITA if you specifically want mega-cap concentration or need maximum liquidity. Reserve DFEN for short-term tactical trades only — the decay will erode multi-week positions.
