description: "Hybrid securities that blend bond-like income with equity-like risk — high yields with unique characteristics"
---

Preferred stocks are hybrid securities — they sit between common stock and bonds. They pay fixed dividends (like bonds) but represent ownership (like stocks). Yields are competitive with high-yield bonds but with different risk characteristics.

## How preferred stocks work

| Feature | Preferred | Common | Bonds |
|---------|-----------|--------|-------|
| Dividends/Interest | Fixed (usually) | Variable | Fixed |
| Bankruptcy priority | Above common, below bonds | Last | First |
| Price sensitivity | Rates + credit | Earnings | Rates |
| Upside potential | Limited | Unlimited | Limited |

### The preferred paradox

Preferreds have "worst of both worlds" risk:
- **Like bonds**: Fall when rates rise
- **Like stocks**: Fall during credit stress
- **Unlike bonds**: Dividends can be suspended
- **Unlike stocks**: Limited upside

## ETFs compared

| ETF | Duration | Expense | Best For |
|-----|----------|---------|----------|
| [**PFF**](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239826/ishares-preferred-and-income-securities-etf) | ~5.5 years | 0.45% | Benchmark, liquid |
| [**PFFD**](https://www.globalxetfs.com/funds/pffd/) | ~5.2 years | 0.23% | Lower cost |
| [**PGX**](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?productId=PGX) | ~5.8 years | 0.50% | IG focus |
| [**VRP**](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?productId=VRP) | ~3.5 years | 0.50% | Floating rate |

**PFF** is the benchmark — $14+ billion AUM, 451 holdings.

## Sector concentration warning

Preferreds are heavily concentrated in financials:

| Sector | PFF Weight |
|--------|------------|
| Banks | ~30% |
| Insurance | ~15% |
| Diversified Financials | ~10% |
| REITs | ~10% |

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
**Financial sector risk**: During 2008-09 and 2023 bank stress, preferreds crashed. This is not a diversified income stream.

## The 2022-2023 lesson

Preferreds got hit from both sides:
1. **2022**: Rising rates crushed prices (duration)
2. **2023**: Regional bank crisis hit financials (credit)

PFF dropped nearly 25% from 2021 highs.

## When to consider preferreds

✅ **May work when**:
- Stable or falling rates
- Healthy financial sector
- You understand financial sector risk

❌ **Risky when**:
- Rates rising
- Financial sector stress
- You need principal stability

## Quick reference

| Goal | ETF |
|------|-----|
| Broad preferreds | PFF, PFFD |
| Lower cost | PFFD |
| Investment-grade focus | PGX |
| Rate hedge | VRP |

{{< callout type="tip" >}}
**Preferreds offer attractive yields but concentrated sector risk.** They're not "safe" income — they crashed in 2008, struggled in 2022, and got hit again in 2023's bank stress.
