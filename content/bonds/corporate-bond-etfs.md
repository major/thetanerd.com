description: "Investment-grade, high-yield (junk), and floating rate corporate bond ETFs — credit risk across the spectrum"
---

Corporate bonds carry **credit risk** — the possibility that the company can't pay. This risk is compensated with higher yields than treasuries.

## The credit spectrum

| Rating | Category | Default Risk |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| AAA to A- | Investment-grade (high) | Very low |
| BBB+ to BBB- | Investment-grade (low) | Low |
| BB+ to B- | High-yield (junk) | Moderate |
| CCC+ and below | Distressed | High |

The dividing line is **BBB-**. Above = investment-grade. Below = junk.

## Investment-grade ETFs

| ETF | Duration | Expense | Best For |
|-----|----------|---------|----------|
| [**LQD**](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239566/ishares-iboxx-investment-grade-corporate-bond-etf) | ~8.4 years | 0.14% | Benchmark, liquid |
| [**VCSH**](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vcsh) | ~2.7 years | 0.04% | Short-term IG |
| [**VCIT**](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vcit) | ~6.4 years | 0.04% | Intermediate IG |
| [**VCLT**](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vclt) | ~13.4 years | 0.04% | Long-term IG |
| [**IGSB**](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239451/ishares-15-year-investment-grade-corporate-bond-etf) | ~2.7 years | 0.04% | Short-term IG |
| [**LQDH**](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/264542/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-corporate-bond-etf) | ~0 years | 0.24% | Rate-hedged IG |

**LQDH** holds LQD plus interest rate swaps — you get credit spread without rate sensitivity.

### Credit spread signal

The **LQD/TLT** ratio tracks credit conditions:
- **Ratio falling** = Spreads widening, corporates stressed
- **Ratio rising** = Spreads tightening, confidence returning

## High-yield (junk) ETFs

Junk bonds behave like equities during stress — they sell off with stocks, not rally like treasuries.

| ETF | Duration | Expense | Best For |
|-----|----------|---------|----------|
| [**HYG**](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239565/ishares-iboxx-high-yield-corporate-bond-etf) | ~3.8 years | 0.49% | Benchmark, liquid |
| [**JNK**](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/intermediary/etfs/spdr-bloomberg-high-yield-bond-etf-jnk) | ~3.9 years | 0.40% | Alternative to HYG |
| [**SJNK**](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/intermediary/etfs/spdr-bloomberg-short-term-high-yield-bond-etf-sjnk) | ~1.9 years | 0.40% | Short-duration junk |
| [**USHY**](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/291299/ishares-broad-usd-high-yield-corporate-bond-etf) | ~3.6 years | 0.15% | Lowest cost |

**TLT/HYG rising** = Credit stress, risk-off. This ratio often leads equity weakness.

## Floating rate ETFs

Floating rate coupons adjust with rates — minimal duration risk, but credit risk remains.

| ETF | Expense | Best For |
|-----|---------|----------|
| [**FLOT**](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239534/ishares-floating-rate-bond-etf) | 0.15% | IG floating rate |
| [**BKLN**](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?productId=BKLN) | 0.65% | Senior loans (HY) |
| [**SRLN**](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/intermediary/etfs/spdr-blackstone-senior-loan-etf-srln) | 0.70% | Active senior loans |

**FLOT** = investment-grade, low yield. **BKLN** = junk-rated but senior secured, higher yield.

## Quick reference

| Goal | ETF |
|------|-----|
| IG exposure (broad) | LQD |
| IG exposure (low duration) | VCSH, IGSB |
| IG exposure (rate hedged) | LQDH |
| High-yield exposure | HYG, JNK |
| High-yield (lower duration) | SJNK |
| High-yield (lowest cost) | USHY |
| Rate hike hedge | FLOT |
| Senior loans (higher yield) | BKLN, SRLN |

{{< callout type="tip" >}}
**Corporate bonds sit between treasuries and equities on risk.** IG offers modest yield pickup. HY behaves like stocks during stress — use for yield or as a credit cycle indicator, not as a "safe" bond.
