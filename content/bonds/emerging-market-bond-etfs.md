title: "🌍 Emerging Market Bond ETFs"
description: "USD and local currency EM bonds — higher yields, higher risk, and unique macro signals"
---

Emerging market (EM) bonds offer significantly higher yields than developed market bonds — but with currency risk, political instability, and liquidity challenges.

## Why EM bonds matter

- **Yield premium**: Typically 200-400+ bps over US treasuries
- **Risk appetite indicator**: EM bond flows signal global risk sentiment
- **Dollar sensitivity**: EM debt performance is tightly linked to USD strength

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
**Currency risk is substantial**: Local currency EM bonds can lose 10-20%+ in dollar terms during EM crises, even without defaults.

## What drives EM bonds

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| US rates rising | EM bonds fall (capital flows to safer assets) |
| Dollar strengthening | EM underperforms (harder to service USD debt) |
| Global risk-on | EM spreads tighten, prices rise |
| Commodity prices rising | EM exporters benefit |

## The dollar connection

EM bonds have a powerful inverse relationship with the US dollar:
- **Dollar strengthening**: EM borrowed in dollars but earns in local currency — servicing debt becomes harder
- **Dollar weakening**: Relief for EM borrowers, capital flows into EM for yield

Watch **DXY** and **UUP** alongside EM bond positions.

## EMB/TLT as a signal

| Behavior | Signal |
|----------|--------|
| Rising | Global risk-on, EM bid |
| Falling | EM stress, flight to quality |

EM bond weakness often **precedes** broader risk-off moves.

## Quick reference

{{< callout type="tip" >}}
**EM bonds offer real yield premium, but you're taking dollar, political, and liquidity risk.** They also serve as an excellent early-warning system — when EMB underperforms treasuries, pay attention.
