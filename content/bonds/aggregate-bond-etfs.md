description: "Aggregate bond ETFs for broad fixed-income exposure — the simple approach to bond allocation"
---

Aggregate ETFs hold a broad mix of investment-grade bonds — treasuries, corporates, MBS — in one package. They're the "total stock market" equivalent for bonds.

## What's in an aggregate ETF?

Typical AGG/BND composition:

| Sector | Weight |
|--------|--------|
| Treasuries | ~40% |
| MBS | ~25% |
| Corporates | ~25% |
| Other | ~10% |

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
**No junk bonds**: Aggregate ETFs only hold **investment-grade** bonds (BBB/Baa or higher). For high-yield, add HYG/JNK separately.

## ETFs compared

### US Aggregate

| ETF | Duration | Expense | Best For |
|-----|----------|---------|----------|
| [**AGG**](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239458/ishares-core-us-aggregate-bond-etf) | ~6.0 years | 0.03% | Benchmark |
| [**BND**](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/bnd) | ~6.1 years | 0.03% | Benchmark |
| [**SCHZ**](https://www.schwab.com/research/etfs/quotes/summary/schz) | ~6.2 years | 0.03% | Schwab clients |

**AGG and BND** are the benchmarks. For most passive bond allocation, these are the default choice.

### International/Global

| ETF | Duration | Expense | Best For |
|-----|----------|---------|----------|
| [**BNDX**](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/bndx) | ~7.2 years | 0.07% | International, hedged |
| [**BNDW**](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/bndw) | ~6.6 years | 0.05% | Global (US + international) |
| [**IAGG**](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/279626/ishares-international-aggregate-bond-etf) | ~7.8 years | 0.07% | International, hedged |

**BNDX** is hedged to USD — you get local bond returns without currency volatility.

## Aggregate vs. component parts

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| **Aggregate (AGG/BND)** | Simple, auto-rebalanced | No control over mix |
| **Component ETFs** | Tactical flexibility | More complexity |

For most investors, simplicity wins.

## Quick reference

| Goal | ETF |
|------|-----|
| Broad US bonds | AGG, BND |
| Lowest cost US | SCHZ |
| International (hedged) | BNDX |
| Global (US + international) | BNDW |

{{< callout type="tip" >}}
**Aggregates are "set and forget"** for bond allocation. AGG or BND for US exposure, add BNDX for international diversification, or use BNDW for truly global.
