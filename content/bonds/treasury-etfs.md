description: "US Treasury and inflation-protected bond ETFs — the risk-free foundation of fixed income"
---

US Treasury bonds are backed by the full faith and credit of the US government — the global benchmark for "risk-free" assets. They're the foundation of all fixed income analysis.

## Duration tiers

| Tier | Years | Sensitivity | What It Represents |
|------|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| Short | 1-3 | Low | Cash-like, Fed policy |
| Intermediate | 3-7 | Medium | Near-term outlook |
| Medium | 7-10 | Medium-High | Belly of curve |
| Long | 20+ | High | Long-term expectations |

**Key insight**: A bond with 10-year duration falls ~10% if rates rise 1%.

EDV holds treasury STRIPS — zero-coupon bonds with maximum duration. Use for aggressive rate cut bets.

## TIPS (Inflation-Protected)

TIPS protect purchasing power — the principal adjusts with CPI. The spread between nominal treasuries and TIPS (breakeven inflation) shows market inflation expectations.

| ETF | Duration | Expense | Best For |
|-----|----------|---------|----------|
| [**TIP**](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239467/ishares-tips-bond-etf) | ~6.7 years | 0.19% | Broad TIPS |
| [**SCHP**](https://www.schwab.com/research/etfs/quotes/summary/schp) | ~6.6 years | 0.03% | Lowest cost |
| [**VTIP**](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vtip) | ~2.4 years | 0.04% | Short-duration TIPS |
| [**LTPZ**](https://www.pimco.com/gbl/en/investments/etf/15-year-us-tips-index-exchange-traded-fund) | ~20.2 years | 0.20% | Max inflation sensitivity |

**TIP outperforming TLT** = inflation expectations rising  
**TLT outperforming TIP** = inflation expectations falling
