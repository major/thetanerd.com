Mortgage-backed securities (MBS) are bonds backed by pools of home mortgages. They offer a unique combination of **housing market exposure** and **prepayment risk**.

## The prepayment problem

MBS have **negative convexity** — they behave asymmetrically:

| Rate Environment | What Happens |
|------------------|--------------|
| Rates fall sharply | Homeowners refinance — you get principal back early (at the worst time) |
| Rates rise sharply | No refinancing — duration extends, you're stuck longer |

This asymmetry is why MBS yields are higher than comparable treasuries.

## ETFs compared

| ETF | Duration | Expense | Best For |
|-----|----------|---------|----------|
| [**MBB**](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239465/ishares-mbs-etf) | ~5.9 years | 0.04% | Benchmark, liquid |
| [**VMBS**](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vmbs) | ~5.7 years | 0.04% | Broad MBS |
| [**SPMB**](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/intermediary/etfs/spdr-portfolio-mortgage-backed-bond-etf-spmb) | ~5.8 years | 0.03% | Lowest cost |
| [**GNMA**](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239459/ishares-gnma-bond-etf) | ~5.3 years | 0.10% | Government guaranteed |

**MBB vs VMBS**: Nearly identical — pick based on brokerage. All agency MBS are effectively government-guaranteed.

## Fed policy indicator

The Fed owns trillions in MBS, making it the dominant holder:

| Fed Action | MBS Impact |
|------------|------------|
| Buying MBS | Spreads tighten, supportive |
| Selling/runoff | Spreads may widen |
| QE expansion | Positive for prices |
| QT | Negative for prices |

## When to use MBS

| Use Case | Works? |
|----------|--------|
| Fed policy exposure | Yes |
| Yield above treasuries | Yes (modest spread) |
| Housing market view | Yes (indirect) |
| Avoiding credit risk | Yes (agency-backed) |
| Duration bet | No — use treasuries (no negative convexity) |

## Quick reference

| Goal | ETF |
|------|-----|
| Broad MBS exposure | MBB, VMBS |
| Lowest cost | SPMB |
| Government guaranteed (GNMA) | GNMA |

{{< callout type="tip" >}}
**MBS offer modest yield pickup over treasuries with housing exposure.** The prepayment dynamics create negative convexity — you benefit less from rate drops than you lose from rate rises.
