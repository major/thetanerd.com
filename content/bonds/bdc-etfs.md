description: "Business Development Companies — high-yield private credit exposure with unique risks and rewards"
---

Business Development Companies (BDCs) lend to middle-market businesses — companies too small for investment banks but too large for traditional bank loans. BDC ETFs provide access to this private credit market with yields that can exceed 10%.

## Why BDCs matter

- **Extreme yields**: 9-12%+ dividend yields
- **Floating rate loans**: Most BDC loans are floating rate
- **Private credit exposure**: Access typically reserved for institutions
- **Economic sensitivity**: Performance reflects small/mid-cap business health

## How BDCs work

BDCs must distribute at least 90% of taxable income (like REITs). This creates **high yields** but **little cushion** if loans go bad.

## ETFs compared

| ETF | Expense | Yield | Best For |
|-----|---------|-------|----------|
| [**BIZD**](https://www.vaneck.com/us/en/investments/bdc-income-etf-bizd/) | 13.33%* | ~10-11% | Broad BDC exposure |
| [**PBDC**](https://www.putnam.com/individual/mutual-funds/etfs/pbdc/) | 10%+* | ~9-10% | Active management |

*High expense ratios reflect **acquired fund fees** — underlying BDCs have their own expenses. ETF management fee is ~0.40%.

### Top BIZD holdings

| BDC | Weight |
|-----|--------|
| Ares Capital (ARCC) | ~19% |
| Blue Owl Capital (OBDC) | ~11% |
| Blackstone Secured (BXSL) | ~10% |

## The BDC risk profile

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
**This is not a bond substitute**: BDCs have equity-like volatility. The 10%+ yield comes with 10%+ potential drawdowns.

### What can go wrong

| Risk | Impact |
|------|--------|
| Credit losses | NAV drops, dividends cut |
| Rate reversal | Falling rates = lower income |
| Recession | Middle-market defaults spike |
| NAV erosion | Discounts widen in stress |

## When to consider BDCs

✅ **May work when**:
- Economy stable or expanding
- Interest rates elevated
- You tolerate equity-like volatility
- You understand credit cycles

❌ **Risky when**:
- Recession approaching
- Rates falling rapidly
- You need principal stability

## Quick reference

| Goal | ETF |
|------|-----|
| Broad BDC exposure | BIZD |
| Active management | PBDC |
| Lower-risk alternative | BKLN, SRLN (senior loans) |

{{< callout type="tip" >}}
**BDCs offer 10%+ yields, but you're taking real credit risk.** They behave like small-cap financials in stress. Size positions appropriately.
