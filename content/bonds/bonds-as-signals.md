---

The bond market is often called the "smart money" market — and for good reason. Bonds are dominated by institutional investors, pension funds, and central banks who move billions based on economic fundamentals. When equity traders are still debating whether the rally is real, bond markets have often already voted.

This page focuses on **relative charts** — ratios between treasury ETFs that reveal what big money is actually doing, not what talking heads claim is happening.

## Why bonds matter for equity traders

If you trade stocks or options, you might wonder why you should care about bonds. Here's the uncomfortable truth: **bonds often lead equities**.

| Market | Who Trades It | What Drives It |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| **Equities** | Retail + institutions, emotional | Earnings, sentiment, flows |
| **Bonds** | Institutions, pensions, central banks | Economic data, Fed policy, inflation |

When bond traders start repositioning for recession, rate cuts, or risk-off, that information is embedded in prices **before** equity markets react. Relative charts help you see these shifts in real-time.

### The instruments you need to know

This page uses treasury ETFs across different **durations** — the sensitivity of a bond's price to interest rate changes:

| Duration Tier | ETF | What It Represents |
|---------------|-----|-------------------|
| **Short** (1-3 years) | SHY | Cash-like, Fed policy expectations |
| **Intermediate** (3-7 years) | IEI | Near-term economic outlook |
| **Medium** (7-10 years) | IEF | Belly of the curve |
| **Long** (20+ years) | TLT | Long-term growth/inflation expectations |

We also use **HYG** (high-yield corporate bonds) to measure credit stress.

**For relative charts**, iShares ETFs (SHY, IEI, IEF, TLT) are preferred due to higher liquidity and tighter spreads.

## The key relative charts

### TLT/SPY — The Risk-On/Off Barometer

This is the **foundational ratio** for understanding market regime.

- **TLT/SPY rising**: Treasuries outperforming stocks — flight to safety, risk-off
- **TLT/SPY falling**: Stocks outperforming treasuries — risk appetite strong, risk-on

#### What the ratio tells you

| TLT/SPY Behavior | Market Interpretation | Historical Context |
|------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Sharp spike up | Panic, crisis, flight to safety | March 2020, August 2024 |
| Steady grind up | Deteriorating risk appetite, defensive rotation | Late 2018, 2022 bear |
| Steady grind down | Bull market, risk-on | 2023-2024 rally |
| Sharp drop | Aggressive risk-on, bonds sold for stocks | Post-Fed pivot moves |

#### How to use it

{{% steps %}}

### Establish the trend

Is TLT/SPY in an uptrend, downtrend, or range? This tells you the prevailing regime.

### Watch for divergences

If SPY makes new highs but TLT/SPY is rising (bonds strengthening), smart money may be hedging. Caution warranted.

### Look for regime breaks

Sharp reversals in TLT/SPY often precede equity reversals by days or weeks. Bond markets vote first.

{{% /steps %}}

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
**Correlation caveat**: In 2022, both stocks AND bonds fell together (rising rates crushed both). TLT/SPY was less useful during this period. When inflation is the primary driver, this ratio can give false signals.

### IEI/TLT — The Yield Curve Signal

This ratio compares intermediate-term treasuries (IEI, 3-7 year) to long-term treasuries (TLT, 20+ year). It's a proxy for **yield curve steepening or flattening**.

- **IEI/TLT rising**: Long-end falling faster than intermediate — curve steepening, often signals growth expectations improving or Fed cutting
- **IEI/TLT falling**: Long-end outperforming — curve flattening, often signals growth concerns or flight to duration

#### Why the yield curve matters

The yield curve (spread between short and long-term rates) has predicted every recession since the 1970s. When short-term rates exceed long-term rates (inversion), it signals the market expects the Fed to cut rates due to economic weakness.

| IEI/TLT Behavior | Yield Curve Signal | What's Happening |
|------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Rising | Curve steepening | Long rates rising faster (growth optimism) or short rates falling faster (Fed cutting) |
| Falling | Curve flattening | Long rates falling faster (recession fear) or short rates rising faster (Fed hiking) |

#### The steepening playbook

There are two types of steepening — and they have **opposite implications**:

| Type | What's Happening | Implication |
|------|------------------|-------------|
| **Bear steepening** | Long rates rising, short rates stable | Inflation fears, growth running hot |
| **Bull steepening** | Short rates falling, long rates stable | Fed cutting, recession response |

To distinguish: check if the move is driven by TLT falling (bear steepening) or SHY/IEI rising (bull steepening).

### SHY/TLT — Fed Expectations vs. Long-Term Outlook

This ratio isolates the **front end vs. long end** of the curve.

- **SHY/TLT rising**: Short-end outperforming — Fed rate cuts expected, or long-end selling off on inflation fears
- **SHY/TLT falling**: Long-end outperforming — Flight to duration, recession hedging, or Fed hike expectations

#### Reading Fed pivots

SHY/TLT often moves **before** Fed announcements are official. When this ratio starts rising aggressively, the bond market is pricing in rate cuts — even if the Fed hasn't said a word.

| SHY/TLT Behavior | What Bond Market Is Pricing |
|------------------|----------------------------|
| Rising sharply | Imminent Fed cuts, short rates will fall |
| Falling sharply | Fed staying higher for longer, or panic bid for duration |
| Range-bound | Uncertainty, waiting for data |

### TLT/HYG — Credit Stress Indicator

This ratio compares treasuries to high-yield corporate bonds (junk bonds).

- **TLT/HYG rising**: Treasuries outperforming junk — credit stress, flight to quality
- **TLT/HYG falling**: Junk outperforming treasuries — risk appetite strong, credit spreads tightening

#### Why this matters

High-yield bonds are essentially equity-like credit instruments. When investors dump HYG for TLT, they're saying: "I don't trust corporate credit — give me government paper."

| TLT/HYG Behavior | Credit Market Signal |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Sharp spike up | Credit stress, spreads blowing out, potential crisis |
| Steady rise | Deteriorating credit conditions, caution warranted |
| Falling | Risk-on, spreads tightening, credit flowing freely |

{{< callout type="info" >}}
**Leading indicator**: TLT/HYG often signals equity weakness before SPY reacts. When junk bonds start underperforming treasuries, equity bulls should take note.
{{< /callout >}}

### IEF/TLT — The Belly vs. Long End

This ratio is more nuanced — it compares the "belly" of the curve (7-10 year) to the long end (20+ year).

- **IEF/TLT rising**: Belly outperforming — less conviction on duration, uncertainty about long-term rates
- **IEF/TLT falling**: Long-end bid — strong conviction on rate cuts or flight to maximum duration

#### When to watch this

IEF/TLT becomes important during **Fed pivot periods**. When the market believes rate cuts are coming:

1. First, the whole curve rallies (all treasury ETFs up)
2. Then, duration outperforms (TLT leads IEF leads SHY)
3. IEF/TLT falling confirms conviction in the rate cut thesis

If IEF/TLT is rising during a supposed "pivot trade," be skeptical — the belly outperforming suggests uncertainty.

## Putting the ratios together

No single ratio tells the complete story. Here's how to read them as a **dashboard**:

### Risk-on regime

| Ratio | Behavior | Confirmation |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| TLT/SPY | Falling | ✓ Stocks preferred over bonds |
| TLT/HYG | Falling | ✓ Credit risk embraced |
| IEI/TLT | Rising or flat | ✓ No rush to duration |
| SHY/TLT | Flat or rising | ✓ No panic bid for long bonds |

### Risk-off regime

| Ratio | Behavior | Confirmation |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| TLT/SPY | Rising | ✓ Flight to safety |
| TLT/HYG | Rising | ✓ Credit stress |
| IEI/TLT | Falling | ✓ Demand for duration |
| SHY/TLT | Falling | ✓ Long-end bid |

### Mixed/transitional signals

When ratios disagree, you're often in a **regime transition**. For example:

- TLT/SPY rising BUT TLT/HYG falling = Bonds bid, but credit still confident → Possibly just equity-specific weakness, not broad risk-off
- TLT/SPY falling BUT IEI/TLT falling = Stocks rallying AND demand for duration → Possibly defensive rally, not genuine risk-on

{{< callout type="tip" >}}
**Conflicting signals = smaller position sizes.** When the dashboard is mixed, the market is uncertain. Trade smaller until clarity emerges.

## Practical applications

### Scenario 1: Detecting hidden risk-off

You see SPY grinding higher, making new highs. Everyone is bullish. But:

- TLT/SPY is rising (bonds outperforming)
- TLT/HYG is rising (credit stress emerging)
- IEI/TLT is falling (duration demand)

**Interpretation**: Smart money is hedging. The equity rally may be on borrowed time. Consider:
- Tightening stops on long equity positions
- Reducing position sizes
- Adding TLT as a hedge

### Scenario 2: Confirming a Fed pivot trade

The Fed hints at rate cuts. Everyone piles into TLT. But is it real?

Check the ratios:
- SHY/TLT falling? ✓ Long-end leading (conviction)
- IEI/TLT falling? ✓ Duration in demand
- TLT/HYG falling? ✓ Risk appetite returning

If all three confirm, the pivot trade has legs. If TLT/HYG is rising (credit stress), the market may be buying bonds for the wrong reason (fear, not Fed).

### Scenario 3: Yield curve steepening alert

You notice IEI/TLT rising sharply. What type of steepening?

1. Check TLT — is it falling? → Bear steepening (long rates up, inflation fear)
2. Check SHY — is it rising? → Bull steepening (short rates down, Fed cutting)

**Bear steepening** often precedes equity volatility. **Bull steepening** often accompanies Fed easing cycles (can be equity positive, but watch for "cutting into weakness").

## Daily monitoring checklist

{{% steps %}}

### Check TLT/SPY

What's the regime? Rising = risk-off, falling = risk-on. Note any divergences from equity price action.

### Check TLT/HYG

Credit stress emerging? Rising ratio = caution, falling = all-clear.

### Check IEI/TLT or SHY/TLT

Yield curve signal? Look for steepening/flattening and identify the type.

### Synthesize

Do the ratios confirm each other? If mixed, reduce conviction and position size.

## Common mistakes

### Mistake 1: Ignoring the inflation regime

In 2022, rising rates crushed both stocks AND bonds. TLT/SPY gave misleading signals because the correlation flipped. **Always know whether you're in an inflation-driven or growth-driven environment.**

### Mistake 2: Trading single ratios in isolation

TLT/SPY rising doesn't automatically mean "sell stocks." It's one input. Combine with credit spreads (TLT/HYG), curve signals (IEI/TLT), and equity internals for a complete picture.

### Mistake 3: Forgetting liquidity matters

During genuine crises (March 2020), correlations break down and everything sells. In these moments, ratios can whipsaw violently. Don't overtrade the noise — wait for stabilization.

### Mistake 4: Overcomplicating it

You don't need 20 ratios. Master these four:
1. **TLT/SPY** — risk-on/off regime
2. **TLT/HYG** — credit stress
3. **IEI/TLT** — yield curve
4. **SHY/TLT** — Fed expectations

Everything else is refinement.

## Quick reference

| Ratio | Rising Means | Falling Means | Primary Use |
|-------|--------------|---------------|-------------|
| **TLT/SPY** | Risk-off, bonds preferred | Risk-on, stocks preferred | Regime identification |
| **TLT/HYG** | Credit stress, flight to quality | Credit confidence, risk-on | Early warning |
| **IEI/TLT** | Curve steepening | Curve flattening | Economic expectations |
| **SHY/TLT** | Fed cuts expected | Duration demand, Fed hold | Fed policy timing |
| **IEF/TLT** | Belly preferred, uncertainty | Duration conviction | Pivot confirmation |

{{< callout type="tip" >}}
**The bottom line**: Bond markets are where institutions express their true views. Equity prices can be noisy, meme-driven, and emotional. Treasury ETF ratios cut through the noise and show you what the "smart money" is actually doing. Master TLT/SPY and TLT/HYG first — they'll catch most regime shifts before they show up in stock prices.
