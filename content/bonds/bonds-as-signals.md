The bond market is dominated by institutional investors, pension funds, and central banks who move billions based on economic fundamentals. When equity traders are still debating whether the rally is real, bond markets have often already voted.

## Core ratios

### TLT/SPY — Risk-On/Off Barometer

| Behavior | Signal |
|----------|--------|
| Rising | Flight to safety, risk-off |
| Falling | Stocks preferred, risk-on |
| Sharp spike | Panic, crisis |
| Diverging from SPY highs | Warning — smart money hedging |

### TLT/HYG — Credit Stress Indicator

| Behavior | Signal |
|----------|--------|
| Rising | Credit stress, spreads widening |
| Falling | Risk appetite, spreads tightening |
| Sharp spike | Potential crisis brewing |

{{< callout type="info" >}}
TLT/HYG often signals equity weakness before SPY reacts. When junk underperforms treasuries, equity bulls should take note.

### IEI/TLT — Yield Curve Signal

| Behavior | Signal |
|----------|--------|
| Rising | Curve steepening (growth optimism or Fed cutting) |
| Falling | Curve flattening (recession fear or Fed hiking) |

**Two types of steepening:**
- **Bear steepening**: TLT falling — inflation fears
- **Bull steepening**: SHY/IEI rising — Fed cutting

### SHY/TLT — Fed Expectations

| Behavior | Signal |
|----------|--------|
| Rising sharply | Imminent Fed cuts expected |
| Falling sharply | Duration demand, Fed holding |
| Range-bound | Uncertainty, waiting for data |

### EMB/TLT — Global Risk Appetite

| Behavior | Signal |
|----------|--------|
| Rising | Global risk-on, EM bid, dollar weak |
| Falling | EM stress, flight to quality, dollar strong |

EM bond weakness often **precedes** broader risk-off moves.

## Cycle phases

### Accumulation

**Signals:** TLT/SPY bottoming, credit spreads stabilizing, EMB/TLT inflecting up

**Action:** Accumulate risk assets. Consider reducing treasury overweight.

### Confirmation

**Signals:** TLT/SPY in clear downtrend, TLT/HYG falling, curve stable

**Action:** Hold risk positions. Add on pullbacks.

### Distribution

**Signals:** TLT/SPY rising while SPY makes new highs, TLT/HYG inflecting up

**Action:** Tighten stops. Reduce high-beta. Consider TLT as hedge.

## Trading strategies

### Risk-Off Hedge

**Setup:** TLT/SPY breaking out from downtrend  
**Entry:** Buy TLT on breakout confirmation  
**Exit:** TLT/SPY breaks below 50-day MA

### Credit Stress Trade

**Setup:** TLT/HYG breaking out while SPY still stable  
**Entry:** Long TLT, short HYG (or reduce equity)  
**Exit:** TLT/HYG breaks down

### Fed Pivot Trade

**Setup:** SHY/TLT falling sharply (duration demand)  
**Entry:** Buy TLT when Fed pivot signals emerge  
**Exit:** TLT/HYG rising (buying bonds for fear, not Fed)

## Common mistakes

1. **Ignoring inflation regimes** — In 2022, both stocks AND bonds fell. TLT/SPY gave misleading signals.
2. **Trading single ratios** — TLT/SPY rising doesn't automatically mean "sell stocks." Combine with credit spreads.
3. **Forgetting liquidity** — During crises (March 2020), everything sells. Wait for stabilization.

## Ratio quick reference

| Ratio | Rising = | Falling = |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| **TLT/SPY** | Risk-off | Risk-on |
| **TLT/HYG** | Credit stress | Credit confidence |
| **IEI/TLT** | Curve steepening | Curve flattening |
| **SHY/TLT** | Fed cuts expected | Duration demand |
| **EMB/TLT** | Global risk-on | EM stress |
