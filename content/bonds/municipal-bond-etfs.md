---

Municipal bonds ("munis") are debt issued by state and local governments. Their key feature: **interest is typically exempt from federal income tax** — and often state tax too if you buy in-state.

## Tax-equivalent yield

To compare munis to taxable bonds:

```
Tax-equivalent yield = Muni yield / (1 - marginal tax rate)
```

| Tax Bracket | 4% Muni = |
|-------------|-----------|
| 24% | 5.26% taxable |
| 32% | 5.88% taxable |
| 37% | 6.35% taxable |

### Double tax exemption

High-tax state residents get an extra benefit from in-state munis:

| State | State Rate | 4% Muni = |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| California | 13.3% | 8.05% taxable |
| New York | 10.9% | 7.68% taxable |
| New Jersey | 10.75% | 7.66% taxable |

| [**NYF**](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239781/ishares-new-york-muni-bond-etf) | New York | 0.25% |

## When munis make sense

| Situation | Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------|
| High federal tax bracket (32%+) | Strong candidate |
| High state taxes + federal | Very strong (use state-specific) |
| Tax-advantaged account (IRA) | **No benefit** — use taxable bonds |
| Low tax bracket | Usually not worth it |

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
**Never hold munis in IRAs or 401(k)s.** The tax exemption is wasted in tax-advantaged accounts.

## Quick reference

| Goal | ETF |
|------|-----|
| Broad national munis | MUB, VTEB |

| California residents | CMF |
| New York residents | NYF |

{{< callout type="tip" >}}
**Munis are a tax play** — their value depends entirely on your marginal tax rate. Calculate your tax-equivalent yield before buying.
