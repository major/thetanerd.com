Municipal bonds ("munis") are debt issued by state and local governments to fund infrastructure, schools, hospitals, and other public projects. Their key feature: **interest is typically exempt from federal income tax** — and often state tax too if you buy in-state.

## Why munis matter

Munis offer a unique value proposition for high-income investors:

- **Tax advantage**: For high-income investors, tax-equivalent yields can exceed corporates
- **State/local credit**: Muni health reflects local economic conditions
- **Low default rates**: Historically much lower defaults than corporate bonds
- **Double tax exemption**: State-specific munis avoid federal AND state taxes

## Tax-equivalent yield

To compare munis to taxable bonds, calculate the tax-equivalent yield:

```
Tax-equivalent yield = Muni yield / (1 - marginal tax rate)
```

### Examples by tax bracket

| Tax Bracket | Muni Yield | Tax-Equivalent Yield |
|-------------|------------|---------------------|
| 24% | 4.0% | 5.26% |
| 32% | 4.0% | 5.88% |
| 35% | 4.0% | 6.15% |
| 37% | 4.0% | 6.35% |

This means a 4% muni is equivalent to a **6.35% taxable bond** for someone in the 37% bracket. The higher your tax rate, the more valuable the tax exemption.

### State tax benefit

If you're in a high-tax state (California, New York, New Jersey), buying state-specific munis provides **double tax exemption**:

| Your State | State Rate | Combined Benefit | Tax-Equivalent (4% muni) |
|------------|-----------|------------------|-------------------------|
| California | 13.3% | 50.3% | 8.05% |
| New York | 10.9% | 47.9% | 7.68% |
| New Jersey | 10.75% | 47.75% | 7.66% |

This is why high-income residents of high-tax states often allocate heavily to in-state munis.

| ETF | Name | State | Expense Ratio |
|-----|------|-------|---------------|
| [**CMF**](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239696/ishares-california-muni-bond-etf) | iShares California Muni Bond | California | 0.25% |
| [**NYF**](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239781/ishares-new-york-muni-bond-etf) | iShares New York Muni Bond | New York | 0.25% |
| [**NKG**](https://www.vaneck.com/us/en/investments/intermediate-muni-etf/) | VanEck Intermediate Muni | National (intermediate) | 0.20% |

## When munis make sense

| Your Situation | Muni Consideration |
|----------------|-------------------|
| High federal tax bracket (32%+) | Strong candidate |
| High state taxes + federal | Very strong (use state-specific ETF) |
| Tax-advantaged account (IRA, 401k) | No benefit — use taxable bonds instead |
| Low tax bracket | Usually not worth it |
| Want credit diversification | National ETFs (MUB, VTEB) |
| Want maximum yield (taxable account) | Calculate tax-equivalent yield first |

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
**Never hold munis in IRAs or 401(k)s.** The tax exemption is wasted in tax-advantaged accounts. Use treasuries or corporates there instead.

## How munis move in different regimes

| Scenario | Muni Behavior | Why |
|----------|---------------|-----|
| Fed cutting rates | Rally | Duration effect |
| Fed hiking rates | Fall | Duration effect |
| State/local fiscal stress | Spreads widen | Credit concerns |
| Recession fear | Mixed | Depends on local economy strength |
| Tax law changes | Can move significantly | Tax benefit may increase or decrease |
| Risk-on | Stable to slight underperformance | Lower volatility, less upside |

## Credit considerations

Munis have historically low default rates, but credit quality varies:

| Rating | Description | Risk Level |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| AAA/AA | High-grade munis | Very low default risk |
| A/BBB | Investment-grade | Low to moderate risk |
| Below BBB | High-yield munis | Higher risk, higher yield |

Most broad muni ETFs (MUB, VTEB) focus on investment-grade bonds. HYD specifically targets high-yield munis for those seeking more risk/reward.

## Quick reference

| Goal | ETF to Consider |
|------|----------------|
| Broad national munis | MUB, VTEB |
| Short-duration munis | SHM |
| High-yield munis | HYD |
| Long-duration munis | MLN |
| California residents | CMF |
| New York residents | NYF |

{{< callout type="tip" >}}
**The bottom line**: Munis are a **tax play** — their value depends entirely on your marginal tax rate. Calculate your tax-equivalent yield before buying. For high-income investors in high-tax states, munis can offer effective yields that rival or exceed high-yield corporates with lower credit risk.
