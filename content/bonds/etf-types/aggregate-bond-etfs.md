description: "Aggregate bond ETFs for broad fixed-income exposure — the simple approach to bond allocation"
---

Aggregate ETFs hold a broad mix of investment-grade bonds — treasuries, corporates, MBS — in one package. They're the "total stock market" equivalent for bonds: simple, diversified, and low-cost.

## Why aggregates matter

Aggregate ETFs serve a straightforward purpose:

- **Simplicity**: One ETF, broad bond exposure
- **Diversification**: Mix of government, corporate, and securitized bonds
- **Benchmark**: AGG/BND track the Bloomberg US Aggregate — the standard bond benchmark
- **Low cost**: Expense ratios of 0.03% across major options

For investors who don't want to make tactical calls on duration or credit, aggregates are the default answer.

## What's in an aggregate ETF?

Typical composition of AGG/BND:

| Sector | Weight | What It Is |
|--------|--------|------------|
| **Treasuries** | ~40% | US government bonds |
| **MBS** | ~25% | Agency mortgage-backed securities |
| **Corporates** | ~25% | Investment-grade corporate bonds |
| **Other** | ~10% | Agencies, ABS, CMBS |

**No junk bonds**: Aggregate ETFs only hold **investment-grade** bonds. If you want high-yield exposure, you need to add it separately (HYG, JNK).

## Which aggregate bond ETFs should I watch?

### US Aggregate Bond ETFs

| ETF | Name | Duration | Expense Ratio | What It Tracks |
|-----|------|----------|---------------|----------------|
| [**AGG**](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239458/ishares-core-us-aggregate-bond-etf) | iShares Core US Aggregate | ~6.0 years | 0.03% | Bloomberg US Aggregate |
| [**BND**](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/bnd) | Vanguard Total Bond Market | ~6.1 years | 0.03% | Broad US investment-grade |
| [**SCHZ**](https://www.schwab.com/research/etfs/quotes/summary/schz) | Schwab US Aggregate Bond | ~6.2 years | 0.03% | US aggregate |

**AGG and BND** are the benchmarks. For most passive bond allocation, these are the default choice.

### International/Global Aggregate Bond ETFs

For global diversification, consider adding international bond exposure:

| ETF | Name | Duration | Expense Ratio | What It Tracks |
|-----|------|----------|---------------|----------------|
| [**BNDX**](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/bndx) | Vanguard Total International Bond | ~7.2 years | 0.07% | Non-US investment-grade, hedged to USD |
| [**IAGG**](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/279626/ishares-international-aggregate-bond-etf) | iShares International Aggregate | ~7.8 years | 0.07% | International aggregate, hedged |
| [**BNDW**](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/bndw) | Vanguard Total World Bond | ~6.6 years | 0.05% | Global aggregate (US + international) |

### What's the difference?

- **AGG vs BND vs SCHZ**: Nearly identical — pick based on brokerage preference
- **BNDX**: International bonds hedged to USD — diversifies across global rates
- **BNDW**: Combines BND + BNDX in one package — truly global exposure

## When to use aggregates

| Use Case | Aggregate ETF Works? |
|----------|---------------------|
| Simple bond allocation | Yes — one-stop shop |
| Passive portfolio (stocks + bonds) | Yes — pair with VTI/SPY |
| Tactical duration or credit bets | No — use targeted ETFs |
| Tax-advantaged accounts | Yes — simple and efficient |
| Global diversification | Add BNDX or use BNDW |

## How aggregates move in different regimes

| Scenario | Aggregate Behavior | Why |
|----------|-------------------|-----|
| Fed cutting rates | Rally | Duration effect (40% treasuries) |
| Fed hiking rates | Fall | Duration effect |
| Recession fear | Rally | Treasury weight helps, flight to quality |
| Risk-on | Slight underperform vs. corporates | Less credit exposure |
| Credit stress | Mixed | Corporate weight hurts, treasury weight helps |
| Dollar weakness | Neutral (US-only) or positive (BNDX/BNDW) | International holdings benefit |

## Aggregate vs. component parts

Why not just hold treasuries, corporates, and MBS separately? You could, but aggregates offer advantages:

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| **Aggregate (AGG/BND)** | Simple, auto-rebalanced, tax-efficient | No control over mix |
| **Component ETFs** | Tactical flexibility, precise allocation | More complexity, rebalancing needed |

For most investors, the simplicity of aggregates outweighs the control of component parts.

## International bond considerations

Adding BNDX provides:

- **Diversification**: Exposure to European, Japanese, and other developed market bonds
- **Currency hedging**: BNDX hedges currency risk back to USD
- **Rate cycle diversification**: Different central banks, different rate cycles
- **Yield differences**: International rates often differ from US rates

**Currency hedging**: BNDX is hedged to USD, meaning you get the local bond returns without currency volatility. This makes it behave more like a bond fund than a currency bet.

### US vs International vs Global

| Approach | ETF | What It Gets You |
|----------|-----|------------------|
| US only | BND, AGG | US interest rate exposure only |
| International only | BNDX | Non-US rate exposure, hedged |
| Global | BNDW | Both in one package (~50/50 split) |

For a truly diversified bond portfolio, many advisors recommend 70-80% US (BND) and 20-30% international (BNDX), or simply using BNDW.

## Quick reference

| Goal | ETF to Consider |
|------|----------------|
| Broad US bond exposure | AGG, BND |
| Lowest cost US aggregate | SCHZ |
| International bonds (hedged) | BNDX |
| Global bonds (US + international) | BNDW |
| Want credit exposure too | Add HYG separately |

{{< callout type="tip" >}}
**The bottom line**: Aggregates are the "set and forget" option for bond allocation. AGG or BND for US exposure, add BNDX for international diversification, or use BNDW for a truly global approach. If you want to make tactical calls on duration, credit, or sectors, use targeted ETFs instead.
