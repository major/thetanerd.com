---

Preferred stocks are hybrid securities — they sit between common stock and bonds in a company's capital structure. They pay fixed dividends (like bonds) but represent ownership (like stocks). For income investors, they offer yields competitive with high-yield bonds but with different risk characteristics.

## Why preferred stocks matter

- **High yields**: Typically 5-7%+ yields, competitive with junk bonds
- **Senior to common**: In bankruptcy, preferred holders get paid before common shareholders
- **Fixed dividends**: Most pay fixed dividends, creating bond-like income streams
- **Rate sensitivity**: Like bonds, preferred prices fall when interest rates rise
- **Tax treatment**: Some dividends qualify for lower tax rates

## How preferred stocks work

| Feature | Preferred Stock | Common Stock | Bonds |
|---------|-----------------|--------------|-------|
| **Dividends/Interest** | Fixed (usually) | Variable | Fixed |
| **Priority in bankruptcy** | Above common, below bonds | Last | First |
| **Voting rights** | Usually none | Yes | None |
| **Price sensitivity** | Interest rates + credit | Earnings + growth | Interest rates |
| **Upside potential** | Limited | Unlimited | Limited |

### The preferred paradox

Preferreds have "the worst of both worlds" risk profile:
- **Like bonds**: They fall when rates rise (duration risk)
- **Like stocks**: They fall during credit stress and recessions
- **Unlike bonds**: Dividends can be suspended (not contractual like bond coupons)
- **Unlike stocks**: Limited upside — you get the dividend, not the growth

This makes preferreds most attractive in **stable or falling rate environments** with **healthy credit conditions**.

## Key preferred stock ETFs

| ETF | Name | Duration | Expense Ratio | What It Tracks |
|-----|------|----------|---------------|----------------|
| [**PFF**](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239826/ishares-preferred-and-income-securities-etf) | iShares Preferred and Income Securities | ~5.5 years | 0.45% | Broad US preferreds (451 holdings) |
| [**PFFD**](https://www.globalxetfs.com/funds/pffd/) | Global X US Preferred ETF | ~5.2 years | 0.23% | US preferreds (lower cost) |
| [**PGX**](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?productId=PGX) | Invesco Preferred ETF | ~5.8 years | 0.50% | Investment-grade focus |
| [**VRP**](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?productId=VRP) | Invesco Variable Rate Preferred ETF | ~3.5 years | 0.50% | Floating rate preferreds |

**PFF** is the benchmark — $14+ billion in AUM, 451 holdings, highest liquidity. **PFFD** offers similar exposure at lower cost. **VRP** provides rate protection with variable-rate preferreds.

## Sector concentration warning

Preferred stocks are heavily concentrated in financials:

| Sector | Approximate Weight in PFF |
|--------|--------------------------|
| **Banks** | ~30% |
| **Insurance** | ~15% |
| **Diversified Financials** | ~10% |
| **REITs** | ~10% |
| **Utilities** | ~10% |
| **Other** | ~25% |

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
**Financial sector risk**: Because preferreds are dominated by banks and financials, they're extremely sensitive to financial sector stress. During the 2008-09 crisis and the 2023 regional bank stress, preferreds sold off sharply. A diversified "bond-like" income stream this is not.

## What drives preferred stock prices

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Interest rates** | Rising rates → prices fall (like bonds) |
| **Credit conditions** | Widening spreads → prices fall |
| **Financial sector health** | Bank stress → preferreds crash |
| **Fed policy** | Rate cuts → preferreds rally |
| **Call risk** | If rates fall, issuers may call preferreds early |

### The 2022-2023 lesson

Preferred stocks got hit from both sides:
1. **2022**: Rising rates crushed prices (duration)
2. **2023**: Regional bank crisis hit financials (credit/sector)

PFF dropped nearly 25% from 2021 highs — more than many bond funds. The "defensive income" reputation proved hollow.

## How preferred stocks move in different regimes

| Scenario | Preferred Stock Behavior |
|----------|-------------------------|
| **Fed cutting** | Rally (duration benefit) |
| **Fed hiking** | Fall hard (duration + credit stress) |
| **Stable rates, healthy economy** | Best environment — steady income |
| **Financial crisis** | Crash (sector concentration) |
| **Mild recession** | Underperform (credit concerns) |
| **Inflation surge** | Fall (rates rise) |

## Preferreds vs. alternatives

| Goal | Consider | Why |
|------|----------|-----|
| Pure yield | HYG, JNK | Similar yields, more diversified |
| Rate protection | FLOT, VRP | Floating rates reduce duration |
| Stable income | Dividend stocks | More upside, less rate sensitivity |
| Senior claim | Investment-grade bonds | Safer in bankruptcy |
| Bank exposure specifically | KRE (bank ETF) | If you want financials, get the upside too |

## Quick reference by use case

| Goal | ETF(s) to Consider |
|------|-------------------|
| Broad preferred exposure | PFF, PFFD |
| Lower cost preferreds | PFFD |
| Investment-grade focus | PGX |
| Floating rate (rate hedge) | VRP |

{{< callout type="tip" >}}
**The bottom line**: Preferred stocks offer attractive yields but come with concentrated sector risk and bond-like duration exposure. They're not a "safe" income source — they crashed in 2008, struggled in 2022, and got hit again in 2023's bank stress. Use them for yield in stable environments, but understand you're taking both rate and financial sector risk.
