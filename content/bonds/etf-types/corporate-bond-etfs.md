description: "Investment-grade, high-yield (junk), and floating rate corporate bond ETFs — credit risk across the spectrum"
---

Corporate bonds are debt issued by companies. Unlike treasuries (government-backed, "risk-free"), corporate bonds carry **credit risk** — the possibility that the company can't pay. This risk is compensated with higher yields.

This page covers the corporate bond spectrum: investment-grade (safe), high-yield/junk (risky), and floating rate (rate-hedge).

## The credit spectrum

| Rating | Category | What It Means | Default Risk |
|--------|----------|---------------|--------------|
| AAA to A- | Investment-grade (high) | Strong balance sheet, stable cash flows | Very low |
| BBB+ to BBB- | Investment-grade (low) | Adequate, but more sensitive to economic stress | Low |
| BB+ to B- | High-yield (junk) | Speculative, higher leverage | Moderate |
| CCC+ and below | Distressed | Significant default risk | High |

The dividing line is **BBB-**. Above = investment-grade. Below = junk.

## Investment-grade corporate bonds

Investment-grade corporates offer a yield premium over treasuries while maintaining relatively low default risk. They're the "Goldilocks" of fixed income — more yield than govs, less risk than junk.

### Why investment-grade matters

- **Yield premium**: Higher yields than treasuries (the "credit spread")
- **Economic sensitivity**: Corporate credit health reflects business conditions
- **Between treasuries and stocks**: More yield than govs, less risk than equities

### What drives investment-grade prices

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Interest rates** | Like treasuries — rates up, prices down |
| **Credit spreads** | Wider spreads = fear, tighter = confidence |
| **Corporate earnings** | Stronger earnings = tighter spreads |
| **Economic outlook** | Recession fears widen spreads |

### Key investment-grade ETFs

| ETF | Name | Duration | Expense Ratio | What It Tracks |
|-----|------|----------|---------------|----------------|
| [**LQD**](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239566/ishares-iboxx-investment-grade-corporate-bond-etf) | iShares iBoxx $ IG Corporate | ~8.4 years | 0.14% | Broad IG corporates |
| [**VCSH**](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vcsh) | Vanguard Short-Term Corp | ~2.7 years | 0.04% | Short-term IG |
| [**VCIT**](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vcit) | Vanguard Intermediate Corp | ~6.4 years | 0.04% | Intermediate IG |
| [**VCLT**](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vclt) | Vanguard Long-Term Corp | ~13.4 years | 0.04% | Long-term IG |
| [**IGSB**](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239451/ishares-15-year-investment-grade-corporate-bond-etf) | iShares 1-5 Year IG Corp | ~2.7 years | 0.04% | Short-term IG |
| [**IGIB**](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239463/ishares-510-year-investment-grade-corporate-bond-etf) | iShares 5-10 Year IG Corp | ~7.2 years | 0.04% | Intermediate IG |

**LQD** is the benchmark — high liquidity, broad exposure. For lower duration risk, use VCSH or IGSB.

### Interest rate hedged corporate bonds

If you want investment-grade corporate credit exposure **without** interest rate risk, hedged ETFs use interest rate swaps to neutralize duration:

| ETF | Name | Effective Duration | Expense Ratio | What It Tracks |
|-----|------|-------------------|---------------|----------------|
| [**LQDH**](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/264542/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-corporate-bond-etf) | iShares Interest Rate Hedged Corp Bond | ~0 years | 0.24% | LQD + rate hedge overlay |

**LQDH** essentially holds LQD (investment-grade corporates) plus interest rate swaps that offset duration exposure. The result is near-zero effective duration — you get the credit spread without rate sensitivity.

| Scenario | LQD Behavior | LQDH Behavior |
|----------|--------------|---------------|
| Rates rise, spreads stable | Falls (duration) | Flat |
| Rates fall, spreads stable | Rises (duration) | Flat |
| Spreads widen (credit stress) | Falls | Falls |
| Spreads tighten (risk-on) | Rises | Rises |

**When to use LQDH**: When you want corporate credit exposure but expect rates to rise, or when you want to isolate pure credit spread movements without rate noise.

### The credit spread signal

The spread between corporate bonds and treasuries (LQD yield minus comparable treasury yield) is a key indicator:

- **Spreads widening**: Fear rising, corporate credit under stress
- **Spreads tightening**: Confidence returning, risk-on

You can approximate this by watching **LQD/TLT** — when this ratio falls, corporates are underperforming treasuries (spreads widening).

## High-yield (junk) bonds

High-yield bonds are rated below BBB- — companies with weaker balance sheets, higher leverage, or less predictable cash flows. Higher risk, higher yield.

### Why junk bonds matter

- **Equity-like behavior**: Junk bonds often trade like stocks, not bonds
- **Credit cycle indicator**: Junk spreads are one of the best recession predictors
- **Yield hunting**: In low-rate environments, capital chases junk for income

### The junk bond paradox

Junk bonds sit in a strange place: they're bonds (fixed income, contractual payments), but they behave like equities during stress. When risk appetite disappears, junk bonds get sold alongside stocks.

| Market Environment | Treasury Behavior | Junk Bond Behavior |
|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Risk-on | Flat to down | Rally with stocks |
| Risk-off | Rally (flight to safety) | Sell off with stocks |
| Rising rates | Fall (duration) | Mixed (spread tightening can offset) |
| Recession | Rally hard | Crash (defaults rise) |

### Key high-yield ETFs

| ETF | Name | Duration | Expense Ratio | What It Tracks |
|-----|------|----------|---------------|----------------|
| [**HYG**](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239565/ishares-iboxx-high-yield-corporate-bond-etf) | iShares iBoxx $ High Yield | ~3.8 years | 0.49% | Broad high-yield corporates |
| [**JNK**](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/intermediary/etfs/spdr-bloomberg-high-yield-bond-etf-jnk) | SPDR Bloomberg High Yield | ~3.9 years | 0.40% | Alternative to HYG |
| [**SJNK**](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/intermediary/etfs/spdr-bloomberg-short-term-high-yield-bond-etf-sjnk) | SPDR Short-Term High Yield | ~1.9 years | 0.40% | Short-duration junk |
| [**SHYG**](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/258100/ishares-05-year-high-yield-corporate-bond-etf) | iShares 0-5 Year High Yield | ~2.3 years | 0.30% | Short-duration junk |
| [**USHY**](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/291299/ishares-broad-usd-high-yield-corporate-bond-etf) | iShares Broad USD High Yield | ~3.6 years | 0.15% | Lower cost alternative |

**HYG vs. JNK**: Both track similar indices. HYG is more liquid, JNK has slightly lower expense ratio. Most traders use HYG.

### TLT/HYG — The credit stress ratio

This is one of the most important ratios for equity traders:

- **TLT/HYG rising**: Treasuries outperforming junk — credit stress, risk-off
- **TLT/HYG falling**: Junk outperforming treasuries — risk-on, credit confidence

When TLT/HYG spikes, trouble is brewing. This ratio often leads equity weakness by days or weeks.

## Floating rate and senior loans

Floating rate bonds have coupons that adjust with short-term interest rates. **Senior loans** (also called leveraged loans or bank loans) are floating-rate debt issued by below-investment-grade companies, secured by company assets.

### Why floating rate matters

- **Rate hedge**: When rates rise, coupons rise — minimal duration risk
- **Different risk profile**: Credit risk without duration risk
- **Senior secured**: Loan ETFs hold debt that's senior in the capital structure (better recovery in defaults)

### Key floating rate ETFs

| ETF | Name | Expense Ratio | What It Tracks |
|-----|------|---------------|----------------|
| [**FLOT**](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239534/ishares-floating-rate-bond-etf) | iShares Floating Rate Bond | 0.15% | Investment-grade floating rate |
| [**BKLN**](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?productId=BKLN) | Invesco Senior Loan ETF | 0.65% | Senior secured loans (high yield) |
| [**SRLN**](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/intermediary/etfs/spdr-blackstone-senior-loan-etf-srln) | SPDR Blackstone Senior Loan | 0.70% | Actively managed senior loans |
| [**FLRN**](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/intermediary/etfs/spdr-bloomberg-investment-grade-floating-rate-etf-flrn) | SPDR Bloomberg IG Floating Rate | 0.15% | Investment-grade floating rate |

**FLOT vs. BKLN**: FLOT is investment-grade (low credit risk, low yield). BKLN is junk-rated but senior secured (higher yield, higher risk, but better recovery in defaults).

### When to use floating rate

| Scenario | Floating Rate Behavior |
|----------|----------------------|
| Fed hiking rates | Coupons rise, prices stable — outperforms fixed rate |
| Fed cutting rates | Coupons fall — underperforms fixed rate |
| Credit stress | BKLN/senior loans sell off with junk bonds |

## How corporate bonds move in different regimes

| Scenario | IG Corporates | High Yield | Floating Rate |
|----------|---------------|------------|---------------|
| **Fed cutting** | Rally | Rally | Coupons fall, underperform |
| **Fed hiking** | Fall | Mixed | Coupons rise, outperform |
| **Recession fear** | Spreads widen, fall | Crash | Credit stress hits loans |
| **Inflation surge** | Fall | Mixed | Outperform (floating coupons) |
| **Risk-on** | Spreads tighten, rise | Rally with stocks | Stable |
| **Credit crisis** | Spreads widen, fall | Crash | Senior loans stressed |

## Quick reference by use case

| Goal | ETF(s) to Consider |
|------|-------------------|
| IG exposure (broad) | LQD |
| IG exposure (low duration) | VCSH, IGSB |
| IG exposure (long duration) | VCLT |
| IG exposure (rate hedged) | LQDH |
| High-yield exposure | HYG, JNK |
| High-yield (lower duration) | SJNK, SHYG |
| High-yield (lowest cost) | USHY |
| Rate hike hedge | FLOT, FLRN |
| Senior loans (higher yield) | BKLN, SRLN |

{{< callout type="tip" >}}
**The bottom line**: Corporate bonds sit between treasuries and equities on the risk spectrum. Investment-grade offers modest yield pickup with manageable risk. High-yield behaves like stocks during stress — use it for yield or as a credit cycle indicator, not as a "safe" bond allocation. Floating rate hedges duration risk but not credit risk.
