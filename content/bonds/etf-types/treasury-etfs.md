description: "US Treasury and inflation-protected bond ETFs — the risk-free foundation of fixed income"
---

US Treasury bonds are backed by the full faith and credit of the US government — the global benchmark for "risk-free" assets. They're the foundation of all fixed income analysis. TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) add inflation protection to this foundation.

## Why treasuries matter

- **Risk-free benchmark**: All other bonds are priced as a spread over treasuries
- **Fed policy transmission**: Treasury yields directly reflect Fed rate expectations
- **Flight to safety**: During crises, capital flows into treasuries first
- **Maximum liquidity**: Deepest, most liquid bond market in the world

## Understanding duration

**Duration** measures a bond's price sensitivity to interest rate changes. A bond with 10-year duration will fall approximately 10% if rates rise 1%.

| Duration Tier | Years | Rate Sensitivity | What It Represents |
|---------------|-------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Short** | 1-3 | Low | Cash-like, Fed policy expectations |
| **Intermediate** | 3-7 | Medium | Near-term economic outlook |
| **Medium** | 7-10 | Medium-High | Belly of the curve |
| **Long** | 20+ | High | Long-term growth/inflation expectations |

**Key insight**: When investors shift between durations, they're signaling expectations about the economy and Fed policy.

## Treasury ETFs

### iShares (most liquid)

| ETF | Name | Duration | Expense Ratio | What It Tracks |
|-----|------|----------|---------------|----------------|
| [**SHY**](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239452/ishares-13-year-treasury-bond-etf) | iShares 1-3 Year Treasury | ~1.9 years | 0.15% | Short-term treasuries |
| [**IEI**](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239455/ishares-37-year-treasury-bond-etf) | iShares 3-7 Year Treasury | ~4.4 years | 0.15% | Intermediate treasuries |
| [**IEF**](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239456/ishares-710-year-treasury-bond-etf) | iShares 7-10 Year Treasury | ~7.5 years | 0.15% | Medium-term treasuries |
| [**TLT**](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239454/ishares-20-year-treasury-bond-etf) | iShares 20+ Year Treasury | ~16.5 years | 0.15% | Long-term treasuries |
| [**GOVT**](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239468/ishares-us-treasury-bond-etf) | iShares US Treasury Bond | ~6.2 years | 0.05% | Full treasury curve |

**For most traders**: TLT is the go-to for directional treasury exposure. SHY for cash parking. IEF for balanced duration.

### Vanguard (lower cost)

Vanguard offers lower expense ratios but slightly less liquidity:

| ETF | Name | Duration | Expense Ratio | iShares Equivalent |
|-----|------|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| [**VGSH**](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vgsh) | Vanguard Short-Term Treasury | ~1.9 years | 0.04% | SHY |
| [**VGIT**](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vgit) | Vanguard Intermediate-Term Treasury | ~5.2 years | 0.04% | IEI |
| [**VGLT**](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vglt) | Vanguard Long-Term Treasury | ~16.0 years | 0.04% | TLT |

### Extended duration

For maximum rate sensitivity:

| ETF | Name | Duration | Expense Ratio | What It Tracks |
|-----|------|----------|---------------|----------------|
| [**EDV**](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/edv) | Vanguard Extended Duration | ~24.5 years | 0.06% | Zero-coupon STRIPS |

EDV holds treasury STRIPS (Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal Securities) — zero-coupon bonds with maximum duration. Use for aggressive rate cut bets.

## TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities)

TIPS are treasury bonds with a twist: the principal adjusts with inflation (CPI). They protect purchasing power when inflation rises.

### Why TIPS matter

- **Real yield**: TIPS yield = compensation after inflation
- **Inflation expectations**: The spread between nominal treasuries and TIPS (breakeven inflation) shows what the market expects for future inflation
- **Inflation hedge**: When CPI surprises to the upside, TIPS outperform nominal treasuries

### How TIPS work

| Component | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| **Principal** | Adjusts up/down with CPI monthly |
| **Coupon** | Fixed rate, but paid on adjusted principal |
| **At maturity** | Receive greater of adjusted principal or original |

**Key insight**: TIPS protect against *unexpected* inflation. If inflation comes in higher than expected, TIPS outperform. If inflation comes in lower, nominal treasuries outperform.

### TIPS ETFs

| ETF | Name | Duration | Expense Ratio | What It Tracks |
|-----|------|----------|---------------|----------------|
| [**TIP**](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239467/ishares-tips-bond-etf) | iShares TIPS Bond ETF | ~6.7 years | 0.19% | Broad TIPS exposure |
| [**SCHP**](https://www.schwab.com/research/etfs/quotes/summary/schp) | Schwab US TIPS ETF | ~6.6 years | 0.03% | Lowest cost TIPS |
| [**VTIP**](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vtip) | Vanguard Short-Term TIPS | ~2.4 years | 0.04% | Short-duration TIPS |
| [**STIP**](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239450/ishares-05-year-tips-bond-etf) | iShares 0-5 Year TIPS | ~2.4 years | 0.03% | Short-duration TIPS |
| [**LTPZ**](https://www.pimco.com/gbl/en/investments/etf/15-year-us-tips-index-exchange-traded-fund) | PIMCO 15+ Year TIPS | ~20.2 years | 0.20% | Long-duration TIPS |

**For inflation hedging**: TIP or SCHP for broad exposure. VTIP or STIP for lower duration risk. LTPZ for maximum inflation sensitivity.

### Breakeven inflation

The difference between nominal treasury yields and TIPS yields (same maturity) is called **breakeven inflation** — the market's implied inflation expectation.

- **TIP outperforming TLT**: Inflation expectations rising (or inflation surprising higher)
- **TLT outperforming TIP**: Inflation expectations falling (or deflation fears)

The **TIP/TLT** ratio tracks this relationship in real-time.

## How treasuries move in different regimes

| Scenario | Treasury Behavior | TIPS Behavior |
|----------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Fed cutting** | Rally hard (especially long end) | Rally |
| **Fed hiking** | Fall (especially long end) | Fall |
| **Recession fear** | Rally (flight to safety) | Mixed |
| **Inflation surge** | Fall (real rates repricing) | Outperform nominals |
| **Risk-on** | Flat to down | Underperform |
| **Credit crisis** | Rally hard | Rally |

## Quick reference by use case

| Goal | ETF(s) to Consider |
|------|-------------------|
| Cash parking (minimal risk) | SHY, VGSH |
| Balanced duration | IEF, VGIT |
| Duration play (rate cuts) | TLT, VGLT |
| Maximum duration bet | EDV |
| Inflation hedge (broad) | TIP, SCHP |
| Inflation hedge (low duration) | VTIP, STIP |
| Maximum inflation sensitivity | LTPZ |

{{< callout type="tip" >}}
**The bottom line**: Treasuries are the foundation — everything else in fixed income is priced as a spread over them. Master the duration spectrum (SHY → IEI → IEF → TLT → EDV) and you'll understand how rate expectations flow through the bond market. Add TIPS when you need to hedge or express a view on inflation.
