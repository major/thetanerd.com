Business Development Companies (BDCs) are publicly traded companies that lend to middle-market businesses — companies too small for investment banks but too large for traditional bank loans. BDC ETFs provide access to this private credit market with yields that can exceed 10%.

## Why BDCs matter

- **Extreme yields**: 9-12%+ dividend yields, among the highest in public markets
- **Floating rate loans**: Most BDC loans are floating rate, benefiting from higher rates
- **Private credit exposure**: Access to middle-market lending typically reserved for institutions
- **Monthly or quarterly income**: Regular distributions for income-focused investors
- **Economic sensitivity**: BDC performance reflects small/mid-cap business health

## How BDCs work

BDCs are required by law to:
- Distribute at least 90% of taxable income to shareholders (like REITs)
- Invest at least 70% of assets in qualifying private US companies
- Maintain asset coverage ratios (limits on leverage)

This structure creates **high yields** but also **high payout ratios** — BDCs retain little earnings for growth.

| BDC Characteristic | Implication |
|-------------------|-------------|
| **90%+ distribution** | High yields, but little cushion if loans go bad |
| **Floating rate loans** | Rising rates = higher income (until borrowers default) |
| **Middle-market focus** | Exposed to small business cycle |
| **Leverage limits** | Can't overlever, but still use significant debt |

## Key BDC ETFs

| ETF | Name | Expense Ratio | Yield | What It Tracks |
|-----|------|---------------|-------|----------------|
| [**BIZD**](https://www.vaneck.com/us/en/investments/bdc-income-etf-bizd/) | VanEck BDC Income ETF | 13.33%* | ~10-11% | 32 publicly traded BDCs |
| [**PBDC**](https://www.putnam.com/individual/mutual-funds/etfs/pbdc/) | Putnam BDC Income ETF | 10%+* | ~9-10% | Actively managed BDC exposure |

*The high expense ratios reflect **acquired fund fees** — the underlying BDCs have their own expenses that flow through. The ETF management fee itself is much lower (~0.40%), but total cost to investors includes the BDCs' operating expenses.

### Top BIZD holdings

| BDC | Ticker | Approximate Weight |
|-----|--------|-------------------|
| Ares Capital | ARCC | ~19% |
| Blue Owl Capital Corp | OBDC | ~11% |
| Blackstone Secured Lending | BXSL | ~10% |
| Golub Capital BDC | GBDC | ~4% |
| Hercules Capital | HTGC | ~4% |

**Ares Capital (ARCC)** dominates — it's the largest publicly traded BDC by market cap. BIZD is heavily concentrated in the top 5 names.

## The BDC risk profile

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
**This is not a bond substitute**: BDCs have equity-like volatility with high sensitivity to credit cycles and economic downturns. The 10%+ yield comes with 10%+ potential drawdowns.

### What can go wrong

| Risk | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Credit losses** | If borrowers default, BDC NAV drops and dividends get cut |
| **Rate reversal** | Floating rates help now, but rapidly falling rates = lower income |
| **Economic recession** | Middle-market companies fail first — BDC portfolios suffer |
| **NAV erosion** | BDCs often trade at premiums/discounts to NAV; in stress, discounts widen |
| **Dividend cuts** | When credit losses mount, dividends get slashed |

### Historical behavior

| Environment | BDC Behavior |
|-------------|--------------|
| **Strong economy, rising rates** | Excellent — higher income, low defaults |
| **Stable economy** | Good — steady income |
| **Slowing economy** | Caution — credit concerns emerge |
| **Recession** | Poor — defaults spike, dividends cut, prices crash |
| **Recovery** | Strong bounce — survivors benefit |

## BDCs vs. alternatives

| Goal | BDCs | Alternative | Tradeoff |
|------|------|-------------|----------|
| High yield | 10%+ | HYG (5-6%) | More yield, more risk |
| Floating rate | Yes | BKLN, SRLN | BDCs riskier, higher yield |
| Private credit | Yes | Interval funds | BDCs liquid but volatile |
| Diversified income | Concentrated | Preferreds, MLPs | BDCs = middle-market credit only |

## When to consider BDCs

✅ **BDCs may work when**:
- Economy is stable or expanding
- Interest rates are elevated (floating rate benefit)
- You can tolerate equity-like volatility
- You're focused on current income over total return
- You understand credit cycle dynamics

❌ **BDCs are risky when**:
- Recession approaching (credit losses ahead)
- Rates are falling rapidly (income declines)
- You need principal stability
- You're treating them as "bond alternatives"

## Quick reference

| Goal | ETF to Consider |
|------|----------------|
| Broad BDC exposure | BIZD |
| Active BDC management | PBDC |
| Lower-risk alternative | BKLN, SRLN (senior loans) |

{{< callout type="tip" >}}
**The bottom line**: BDCs offer genuine 10%+ yields, but you're taking real credit risk on middle-market loans. They're not bonds — they behave like small-cap financials in stress. Use them for income in good times, but size positions appropriately and understand that dividends can be cut and prices can drop 20%+ in recessions.
