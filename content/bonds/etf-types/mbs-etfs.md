Mortgage-backed securities (MBS) are bonds backed by pools of home mortgages. When homeowners make mortgage payments, those cash flows pass through to MBS holders. This creates a unique bond type with **housing market exposure** and **prepayment risk**.

## Why MBS matter

MBS occupy a unique space in fixed income:

- **Housing market exposure**: MBS performance reflects housing health
- **Prepayment risk**: When rates fall, homeowners refinance, shortening duration
- **Fed holdings**: The Fed owns trillions in MBS — policy directly affects this market
- **Spread to treasuries**: MBS spreads reflect housing and credit conditions
- **Government backing**: Agency MBS are effectively government-guaranteed

## The prepayment problem

MBS have **negative convexity** — they behave asymmetrically to rate changes:

| Rate Environment | What Happens | MBS Impact |
|------------------|--------------|------------|
| Rates fall sharply | Homeowners refinance | Prepayments accelerate, you get principal back early (at the worst time) |
| Rates rise sharply | No refinancing | Duration extends, you're stuck longer |

This prepayment risk is why MBS yields are higher than comparable treasuries. You're being compensated for the uncertainty.

### How prepayment affects returns

Think of it this way:

- **Rates fall**: You want to hold a high-yielding bond longer, but homeowners refinance and pay you back. Now you must reinvest at lower rates.
- **Rates rise**: You'd prefer to sell and buy a higher-yielding bond, but no one is refinancing. Your capital is locked up in a lower-yielding asset.

This asymmetry is the price of the yield premium MBS offer.

## Which MBS ETFs should I watch?

### Primary MBS ETFs

| ETF | Name | Duration | Expense Ratio | What It Tracks |
|-----|------|----------|---------------|----------------|
| [**MBB**](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239465/ishares-mbs-etf) | iShares MBS ETF | ~5.9 years | 0.04% | Investment-grade MBS |
| [**VMBS**](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vmbs) | Vanguard Mortgage-Backed | ~5.7 years | 0.04% | Broad MBS exposure |
| [**SPMB**](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/intermediary/etfs/spdr-portfolio-mortgage-backed-bond-etf-spmb) | SPDR Portfolio MBS | ~5.8 years | 0.03% | Lowest cost MBS |
| [**GNMA**](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239459/ishares-gnma-bond-etf) | iShares GNMA Bond | ~5.3 years | 0.10% | Ginnie Mae only (government guaranteed) |

**For most purposes**: MBB or VMBS for broad exposure. All agency MBS are effectively government-guaranteed through Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae.

### What's the difference?

- **MBB vs VMBS**: Nearly identical — pick based on brokerage preference
- **SPMB**: Lowest cost, slightly smaller AUM
- **GNMA**: Only Ginnie Mae securities (explicit government guarantee vs. implicit for Fannie/Freddie)

## MBS as a Fed policy indicator

The Fed's MBS holdings and purchase/sales plans directly affect this market:

| Fed Action | MBS Impact | Spread Effect |
|------------|------------|---------------|
| Buying MBS | Supportive of housing | Spreads tighten to treasuries |
| Selling/runoff | Less support | Spreads may widen |
| Balance sheet expansion | Demand for MBS rises | Positive for prices |
| Quantitative tightening | Demand falls | Negative for prices |

Watch Fed balance sheet announcements for MBS policy changes. The Fed owns trillions in agency MBS, making it the dominant holder.

## How MBS move in different regimes

| Scenario | MBS Behavior | Why |
|----------|--------------|-----|
| Fed cutting rates | Rally, but prepayment risk rises | Homeowners refinance |
| Fed hiking rates | Fall, duration extends | No refinancing, stuck longer |
| Recession fear | Slight spread widening | Credit concerns (even though agency-backed) |
| Housing market stress | Spreads widen | Prepayment uncertainty increases |
| Stable rates | Steady income, low volatility | Predictable cash flows |

## When to use MBS ETFs

| Use Case | MBS Works? |
|----------|-----------|
| Fed-watchers who want policy exposure | Yes — Fed holdings matter |
| Seeking yield above treasuries | Yes — modest spread |
| Housing market view | Yes — indirect exposure |
| Avoiding credit risk | Yes — agency-backed |
| Tactical duration bet | No — use treasuries (no negative convexity) |
| Tax-advantaged accounts | Yes — no tax advantage to munis here |

## Quick reference

| Goal | ETF to Consider |
|------|----------------|
| Broad MBS exposure | MBB, VMBS |
| Lowest cost MBS | SPMB |
| Government guaranteed only (GNMA) | GNMA |

{{< callout type="tip" >}}
**The bottom line**: MBS offer a modest yield pickup over treasuries with housing market exposure. The prepayment dynamics create negative convexity — you benefit less from rate drops than you lose from rate rises. Best for investors who want government-backed income and don't mind the prepayment uncertainty.
