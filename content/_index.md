**Welcome!**

This site is a compilation of all of my various notes as I've learned more about financial markets since 2020.
My goal has always been to better understand market mechanics, and this site is a way to organize my thoughts and share them with others.
I hope you learn something here! 💖

Check out my [Goodreads trading bookshelf] to see some of the books I've read along the way.
I hope to write some brief reviews, and maybe evem some summaries of the important parts, in the future.
